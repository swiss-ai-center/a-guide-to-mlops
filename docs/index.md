# A guide to MLOps

We are a team of software engineers and data scientists at the [Centre Suisse d'Intelligence Artificiel Ã  destination des PMEs (CSIA-PME)](https://swiss-ai-center.ch/){:target="\_blank"} who are passionate about Machine Learning (ML) and DevOps.

In this context, we have been working on the redaction of this guide to help you take your ML projects from experiment to production with ease.

We did try to find and use the tools that cause the less friction in established workflows and teams.

During this guide, you will setup a project that you will manage from a traditional approach to a modern MLOps approach designed to improve team collaboration and reproducibility.

The guide is written in a way that you can follow it step by step. It has been written using many different sources that will be mentioned in each step of the process. It is a mix between a tutorial and a course.

The guide is split into 6 parts:

- [Introduction](./introduction/index.md) - Learn about MLOps and the tools used in this guide.
