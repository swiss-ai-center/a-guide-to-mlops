Welcome! We are a team of passionate software engineers and data scientists from
the [Swiss AI Center](https://www.hes-so.ch/swiss-ai-center){:target="\_blank"}.
With expertise in both Machine Learning (ML) and DevOps, our mission is to
provide a comprehensive guide for transitioning ML projects from experimentation
to production.

To achieve this, we have carefully selected the most suitable tools to minimize
friction within established workflows and teams, with a particular focus on
SMEs.

This guide is designed to be practical, leading you step-by-step through the
process of deploying ML models in real-world production environments. You will
gain valuable knowledge and hands-on experience as you progress through the
material.

No matter your level of experience in machine learning, we hope this guide will
support you in achieving greater success in your ML projects!
