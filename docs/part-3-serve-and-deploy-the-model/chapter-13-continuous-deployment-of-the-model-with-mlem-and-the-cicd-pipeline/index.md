## Introduction

## Steps

## State of the MLOps process

- [x] Notebook has been transformed into scripts for production
- [x] Codebase and dataset are versioned
- [x] Steps used to create the model are documented and can be re-executed
- [x] Changes done to a model can be visualized with parameters, metrics and
      plots to identify differences between iterations
- [x] Dataset can be shared among the developers and is placed in the right
      directory in order to run the experiment
- [x] Codebase can be shared and improved by multiple developers
- [x] Experiment can be executed on a clean machine with the help of a CI/CD
      pipeline
- [x] Changes to model can be thoroughly reviewed and discussed before
      integrating them into the codebase
- [x] Model can be saved and loaded with all required artifacts for future usage
- [x] Model can be easily used outside of the experiment context.
- [x] Model can be accessed from a Kubernetes cluster
- [x] Model can be trained on a custom infrastructure with custom hardware for
      specific use-cases

You can now safely continue to the next chapter of this guide concluding your
journey and the next things you could do with your model.
