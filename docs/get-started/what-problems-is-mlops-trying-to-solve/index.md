# What problems is MLOps trying to solve?

_This is a work in progress. Please come back later for more :)_

The problems described in this document are based of our own expericences with ML projects/experiments. They might not reflect all projects and/or teams but we tried to regroup the identified issues in major categories.

It will try to address the following issues that are common to most ML projects.

## The problems

### The codebase still needs to be downloaded and set up locally in order to run the experiment

When a new member of a ML teams

### The dataset still needs to be downloaded and placed in the right directory in order to run the experiment

### The steps used to create the model can be forgotten

### The changes done to a model cannot be visualized and improvements and/or deteriorations are hard to identify

### There is no guarantee that the experiment can be executed on another machine

### The model might have required artifacts that can be forgotten or omitted when saving/loading the model for future usage. There is no easy way to use the model outside of the experiment context
