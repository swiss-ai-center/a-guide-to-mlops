# What is MLOps?

MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, refers to the set of practices and tools used to streamline the deployment, management, and monitoring of machine learning models in production environments.

MLOps combines the principles of software development and operations with data science and machine learning. It involves automating the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preparation and model training to deployment and maintenance, while ensuring that the models are accurate, scalable, and secure.

MLOps typically involves using version control, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure management, containerization, and monitoring and logging tools to manage machine learning workflows. The goal of MLOps is to accelerate the development and deployment of high-quality machine learning models while minimizing errors and downtime.
