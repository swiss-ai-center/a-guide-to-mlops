## Summary

## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared and improved by multiple developers
- ❌ Dataset requires manual download and placement
- ❌ Model steps rely on verbal communication and may be undocumented
- ❌ Changes to model are not easily visualized
- ❌ Experiment may not be reproducible on other machines
- ❌ Model may have required artifacts that are forgotten or omitted in
  saved/loaded state and there is no easy way to use the model outside of the
  experiment context

You will address these issues in the next chapters for improved efficiency and
collaboration. Continue the guide to learn how.
