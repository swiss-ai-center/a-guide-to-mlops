## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared and improved by multiple developers
- ✅ The dataset can be shared among the developers and is placed in the right
  directory in order to run the experiment
- ✅ The steps used to create the model are documented and can be re-executed
- ✅ The changes done to a model can be visualized with parameters, metrics and
  plots to identify differences between iterations
- ✅ The experiment can be executed on a clean machine with the help of a CI/CD
  pipeline and CML
- ❌ Model may have required artifacts that are forgotten or omitted in
  saved/loaded state and there is no easy way to use the model outside of the
  experiment context
