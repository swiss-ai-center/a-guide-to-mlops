# Clean up

Now that you have completed the guide, it is crucial to properly manage and remove
the resources and environments you have created. This is necessary to avoid
unnecessary incurring costs and potential security concerns.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do that.

- Clean up your cloud provider resources
- Clean up your local environment
- Clean up your repository

!!! warning

    If you are using a new cloud account such as Google Cloud, make sure to delete the resources
    you created before the credits are consumed. Otherwise, **you will be charged**
    for the resources you created.

### Cloud providerÂ¶

=== ":simple-amazonaws: Amazon Web Services"

    TODO

=== ":simple-googlecloud: Google Cloud"

    #### Delete the Google Storage bucket

    !!! warning

        If you intend to keep the git repository but proceed with deleting the Google Storage bucket, the DVC remote will be disrupted. To continue using DVC with the Git repository, you will need to reconfigure it with a new remote.

    To delete the Google Storage bucket you created you can execute the following command :

    ```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
    gcloud storage rm --recursive gs://<your bucket name>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can delete the bucket from the Google Cloud Console:

    1. Go to the [Google Cloud Storage Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage){:target="\_blank"}.
    2. Make sure you selected the correct project.
    3. Select the bucket you want to delete from the bucket list.
    4. Click on **Delete** at the top of the page.
    5. Follow the instructions to delete the bucket.

    #### Delete the Service Account

    To delete the service account you created you can execute the following command :

    ```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
    gcloud iam service-accounts delete dvc-service-account@<id of your gcp project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

    Alternatively, you can delete the service account from the Google Cloud Console:

    1. Go to the [Google Cloud IAM Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target="\_blank"}.
    2. Make sure you selected the correct project.
    3. Select the service account you want to delete from the service account list.
    4. Click on **Delete** at the top of the page.
    5. Follow the instructions to delete the service account.

    #### Delete the local Service Account key

    You can run the following command to delete the service account key you created locally:

    ```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
    rm ~/.config/gcloud/dvc-google-service-account-key.json
    ```

    #### Delete the Google Cloud project

    To delete the Google Cloud project you created:

    1. Go to the [Google Cloud Resource Manager Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager){:target="\_blank"}.
    2. Select the project you created.
    3. Click on **Delete** at the top of the page.
    4. Follow the instructions to shut down the project.

```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
# Exit the poetry shell
exit

# Remove the virtual environment
poetry env remove --all
```

To clean up your local environment, you can simply delete the project directory you created for this guide.

### Double-check everything

Before you finish, double-check that you have deleted all the resources and environments you created. This will ensure that you don't incur unexpected costs or leave any security vulnerabilities.

Here is a checklist of all the resources and environments you created:

- [ ] Google Cloud project
- [ ] Google Cloud Storage bucket
- [ ] Google Cloud Service Account
- [ ] Google Cloud Service Account key
- [ ] GitHub/GitLab repository
- [ ] If you used GitLab, you also created a Personal Access Token
- [ ] Project directory on your local machine

### Summary

By following these steps, you have successfully cleaned up the resources and environments you created during the guide. We hope you found this guide helpful and that it has given you a good understanding of the importance of cleaning up after yourself in cloud computing environments.
