77434	1	How to access the last value in a vector? <p>Suppose I have a vector that is nested in a dataframe one or two levels. Is there a quick and dirty way to access the last value, without using the <code>length()</code> function? Something ala PERL's <code>$#</code> special var?</p> <p>So I would like something like:</p> <pre><code>dat$vec1$vec2[$#] </code></pre> <p>instead of</p> <pre><code>dat$vec1$vec2[length(dat$vec1$vec2)] </code></pre>
79709	1	Worse sin: side effects or passing massive objects? <p>I have a function inside a loop inside a function. The inner function acquires and stores a large vector of data in memory (as a global variable... I'm using "R" which is like "S-Plus"). The loop loops through a long list of data to be acquired. The outer function starts the process and passes in the list of datasets to be acquired.</p> <pre><code>for (dataset in list_of_datasets) { for (datachunk in dataset) { &lt;process datachunk&gt; &lt;store result? as vector? where?&gt; } } </code></pre> <p>I programmed the inner function to store each dataset before moving to the next, so all the work of the outer function occurs as side effects on global variables... a big no-no. Is this better or worse than collecting and returning a giant, memory-hogging vector of vectors? Is there a superior third approach?</p> <p>Would the answer change if I were storing the data vectors in a database rather than in memory? Ideally, I'd like to be able to terminate the function (or have it fail due to network timeouts) without losing all the information processed prior to termination.</p>

19	0	What is the fastest way to get the value of π? <p>I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of π, as a personal challenge. More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code> constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p> <p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p> <p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p> <pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt; #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) { \ diff = 0.0; \ time1 = clock(); \ for (i = 0; i &lt; ITERS; ++i) \ diff += (x) - M_PI; \ time2 = clock(); \ printf("%s\t=&gt; %e, time =&gt; %f\n", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1)); \ } static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0) { return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; } int main() { int i; clock_t time1, time2; double diff; /* Warmup.

I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database. My first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn't produce valid CSV - strings aren't encapsulated, so you can't deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it (or whatever you use as a delimiter) and I would still have to hand write all of the create table statements, as obviously CSV doesn't tell you anything about the data types.</p> <p>What would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both SQL Server and MySQL, then do a copy. You lose views, stored procedures, trigger, etc, but it isn't hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one DB to another... is it?</p> <p>Does anybody know of such a tool? I don't mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur, as long as it supports integer, float, datetime and string. I have to do a lot of pruning, normalising, etc. anyway so I don't care about keeping keys, relationships or anything like that, but I need the initial set of data in fast!</p>

This is all setup and functioning in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server" rel="noreferrer">SQL Server</a>.</p> <p>When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.</p> <p>However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data, I typically do something like this:</p> <pre><code>Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable() Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter() taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment) </code></pre> <p>However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the <code>Contract DataTable</code> filled.</p> <p>How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.</p>

I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p> <p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

I wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical leaves, and call it with <code>dendrapply()</code>.</p> <p>However, there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the <code>rect</code>. For horizontal leaves (leaves that are drawn on the right side of the tree), the rightmost edge of the <code>rect</code> either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the <code>rect</code>. For vertical leaves (leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the tree), the bottommost edge of the <code>rect</code> suffers the same display problem.</p> <p>What I had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the <code>rect</code> such that I render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the (horizontal) leaf labels. </p> <p>This eliminates the clipping issue, but introduces another problem, in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels wide, which I don't have much control over. This limits the width of the vertical stripe. </p> <p>The worse problem is that the <code>x</code>-coordinate that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree (<code>par["usr"]</code>), which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being structured.</p> <p>I wrote a "correction" or, better termed, a hack to adjust this <code>x</code> value and the <code>rect</code> width for horizontal trees. It doesn't always work consistently, but for the trees I am making, it seems to keep from getting too close to (or overlapping) edges and labels.</p> <p>Ultimately, a better fix would be to find out how to draw the <code>rect</code> so that there is no clipping. Or a consistent way to calculate the specific <code>x</code> position in between tree edges and labels for any given tree, so as to center and size the stripe properly.</p> <p>I would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line styles.</p>

651	0	Checklist for IIS 6/ASP.NET Windows Authentication? <p>I've been having trouble getting my ASP.NET application to automatically log users into the Intranet site I'm building. No matter the googling or the experimentation I applied, there is always a login box displayed by IE7.</p> <p>I've got Windows authentication mode set in the Web.config, disabled anonymous access and configured the correct default domain in IIS, but it's still asking the user to log in and, more annoyingly, the user is required to provide the domain too (<em>DOMAIN\auser</em>), which is causing problems with non-technical visitors. Thank Zeus for password remembering functionality.</p> <p>I'm not the network administrator so it's possible that something about Active Directory is set up incorrectly, or it could just be me missing something very simple. Please note that I don't want to impersonate the user, I just need to know that the IPrincipal.Name property matches that of a valid record in my user database, hence authenticating the user to my application.</p> <p>To this end, it would be very useful to have a checklist of all configuration requirements for AD, ASP.NET and IIS to work together in this manner as a reference for debugging and hopefully reducing some user friction.</p>

We're using Visual Studio 2005 (though we may be moving to 2008 within the next six months) and work primarily in C#. If the framework has some kind of IDE integration that would be best, but I'm open to frameworks that don't have integration but are still relatively simple to get set up. I'm going to get resistance to it one way or another, so if I can make sure what I'm pushing isn't a pain in the neck, that would help my case.</p> <p>The obvious choice from the research I've done so far points to NUnit, but I'd like to get the impressions of someone who's actually used it before recommending it to my team.</p> <p>Has anyone out there used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUnit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NUnit</a>?

1145	0	Why am I getting a double free or corruption error with realloc()? <p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a <code>char *</code>, which has been allocated using <code>malloc()</code>. It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p> <p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated. If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p> <p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p> <pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) { int searchLen = strlen(search); int replaceLen = strlen(replace); int delta = replaceLen - searchLen; char *find = input; while (find = strstr(find, search)) { if (delta &gt; 0) { realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta); find = strstr(input, search); } memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input)); memmove(find, replace, replaceLen); } } </code></pre> <p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string. (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p> <p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace); int main(void) { char *input = malloc(81); while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) { strrep(input, "Noel", "Christmas"); } } </code></pre>

Unlike the Windows IDE, Linux limits the number of columns to 80, thus making harder the inspection of data sets. Is there a way to set the max number of columns?</p>
1508	0	Different Distributed Version Control Systems working together <p>My office has a central Source Safe 2005 install that we use for source control. I can't change what the office uses on the server. </p> <p>I develop on a laptop and would like to have a different local source control repository that can sync with the central server (when available) regardless of the what that central provider is. The reason for the request is so I can maintain a local stable branch/build for client presentations while continuing to develop without having to jump through flaming hoops. Also, as a consultant, my clients may request that I use their source control provider and flexibility here would make life easier.</p> <p>Can any of the existing distributed source control clients handle that?</p>

With the current amount of Podcasts, it's like searching a needle in a haystack, except that the haystack happens to be the Internet and is filled with too many of these &quot;Hot new Gadgets&quot; stuff :(</p> <p>Now, even though <strong>I</strong> am mainly a .NET developer nowadays, maybe anyone knows some good Podcasts from people regarding the whole software lifecycle? Unit Testing, Continous Integration, Documentation, Deployment...</p> <p>So - what are you guys and gals listening to?</p> <hr /> <p>Please note that the categorizations are somewhat subjective and may not be 100% accurate as many podcasts cover several areas.

1709	0	How to pass enumerated values to a web service <p>My dilemma is, basically, how to share an enumeration between two applications.</p> <p>The users upload documents through a front-end application that is on the web. This application calls a web service of the back-end application and passes the document to it. The back-end app saves the document and inserts a row in the <em>Document</em> table.</p> <p>The document type (7 possible document types: <em>Invoice</em>, <em>Contract</em> etc.) is passed as a parameter to the web service's <em>UploadDocument</em> method. The question is, what should the type (and possible values) of this parameter be?</p> <p>Since you need to hardcode these values in both applications, I think it is O.K. to use a descriptive string (<em>Invoice</em>, <em>Contract</em>, <em>WorkOrder</em>, <em>SignedWorkOrder</em>). </p> <p>Is it maybe a better approach to create a <em>DocumentTypes</em> enumeration in the first application, and to reproduce it also in the second application, and then pass the corresponding integer value to the web service between them?</p>

1829	0	How do I make a menu that does not require the user to press [enter] to make a selection? <p>I've got a menu in Python. That part was easy. I'm using <code>raw_input()</code> to get the selection from the user. </p> <p>The problem is that <code>raw_input</code> (and input) require the user to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:</p> <pre><code>import sys print """Menu 1) Say Foo 2) Say Bar""" answer = raw_input("Make a selection&gt; ") if "1" in answer: print "foo" elif "2" in answer: print "bar" </code></pre> <p>It would be great to have something like</p> <pre><code>print menu while lastKey = "": lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes() if "1" in lastKey: #do stuff... </code></pre>

2043	0	Can a Windows dll retrieve its own filename? <p>A Windows process created from an exe file has access to the command string which invoked it, including its file's path and filename. eg. <code>C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --help</code>.</p> <p>But this is not so for a dll invoked via <code>LoadLibrary</code>. Does anyone know of a way for a function loaded via dll to find out what its path and filename is?</p> <p>Specifically I'm interested in a Delphi solution, but I suspect that the answer would be pretty much the same for any language.</p>

1245273	1	Histogram with Logarithmic Scale and custom breaks <p>I'm trying to generate a histogram in R with a logarithmic scale for y. Currently I do:</p> <pre><code>hist(mydata$V3, breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,25)) </code></pre> <p>This gives me a histogram, but the density between 0 to 1 is so great (about a million values difference) that you can barely make out any of the other bars.</p> <p>Then I've tried doing:</p> <pre><code>mydata_hist &lt;- hist(mydata$V3, breaks=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,25), plot=FALSE) plot(rpd_hist$counts, log="xy", pch=20, col="blue") </code></pre> <p>It gives me sorta what I want, but the bottom shows me the values 1-6 rather than 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 25. It's also showing the data as points rather than bars. <code>barplot</code> works but then I don't get any bottom axis.</p>
2256	0	Mapping Stream data to data structures in C# <p>Is there a way of mapping data collected on a stream or array to a data structure or vice-versa? In C++ this would simply be a matter of casting a pointer to the stream as a data type I want to use (or vice-versa for the reverse) eg: in C++</p> <pre><code>Mystruct * pMyStrct = (Mystruct*)&amp;SomeDataStream; pMyStrct-&gt;Item1 = 25; int iReadData = pMyStrct-&gt;Item2; </code></pre> <p>obviously the C++ way is pretty unsafe unless you are sure of the quality of the stream data when reading incoming data, but for outgoing data is super quick and easy.</p>

I'm migrating the script into Python. It works fine for the most part, but after a PUT command, the size of the file appears to change. Thus, the size of the file is different from that of the file on the server. </p> <p>Once I download again the file from the FTP server, the only difference is the CR/LF mark. This annoys me because the same script is comparing the size of the files to update. Also, in case it means anything, the script works perfectly in PHP vía ftp_put.</p> <pre><code>from ftplib import FTP ftpserver = "myserver" ftpuser = "myuser" ftppass = "mypwd" locfile = "g:/test/style.css" ftpfile = "/temp/style.css" try: ftp = FTP(ftpserver, ftpuser, ftppass) except: exit ("Cannot connect") f = open (locfile, "r") try: ftp.delete (ftpfile) except: pass # ftp.sendcmd ("TYPE I") # ftp.storlines("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f) ftp.storbinary("STOR %s" % ftpfile, f) f.close() ftp.dir (ftpfile) ftp.quit() </code></pre> <p>Any suggestions?</p>

2525	0	.NET obfuscation tools/strategy <p>My product has several components: ASP.NET, Windows Forms App and Windows Service. 95% or so of the code is written in VB.NET.</p> <p>For Intellectual Property reasons, I need to obfuscate the code, and until now I have been using a version of dotfuscator which is now over 5 years old. I'm thinking it is time to move to a new generation tool. What I'm looking for is a list of requirements which I should consider when searching for a new obfuscator.</p> <p>What I know I should look for so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Serialization/De-serialization</em></strong>. In my current solution, I simply tell the tool <strong>not</strong> to obfuscate any class data members because the pain of not being able to load data which was previously serialized is simply too big.</li> <li><strong><em>Integration with Build Process</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Working with ASP.NET</em></strong>. In the past, I have found this problematic due to changing .dll names (you often have one per page) - which not all tools handle well.</li> </ul>

2872	0	Possible to "spin off" several GUI threads? (Not halting the system at Application.Run) <p><strong>My Goal</strong></p> <p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p> <p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p> <p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p> <ol> <li>Application starts.</li> <li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li> <li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li> <li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li> </ol> <p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p> <p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong></p> <p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system "hangs" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p> <p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p> <pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent { public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database } } public class MyComponent2: IComponent { public void DoStuff() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work. } } </code></pre> <p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p> <pre><code>public void DoStuff() { new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start() } private void ThreadedInitialize() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); } </code></pre> <p>Is it possible to spin off a GUI and return after <code>Application.Run()</code>?</p>

1358238	1	Finding a curve to match data <p>I'm looking for a non-linear curve fitting routine (probably most likely to be found in R or Python, but I'm open to other languages) which would take x,y data and fit a curve to it.</p> <p>I should be able to specify as a string the type of expression I want to fit.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <pre><code>"A+B*x+C*x*x" "(A+B*x+C*x*x)/(D*x+E*x*x)" "sin(A+B*x)*exp(C+D*x)+E+F*x" </code></pre> <p>What I would get out of this is at least the values for the constants (A, B, C, etc.) And hopefully stats about the fitness of the match.</p> <p>There are commercial programs to do this, but I expected to be able to find something as common as fitting to a desired expression in a language library nowadays. I suspect SciPy's optimization stuff might be able to do this, but I can't see that it lets me define an equation. Likewise, I can't seem to find exactly what I want in R.</p> <p>Is what I'm looking for out there, or do I need to roll my own? I hate to do it if it's there and I'm just having trouble finding it.</p> <hr> <p>Edit: I want to do this for a bit more control over the process than I get from LAB Fit. The LAB Fit UI is dreadful. I'd also like to be able to break the range into multiple pieces and have different curves represent the different pieces of the range. In the end, the result has to be able to (speed-wise) beat a LUT with linear interpolation or I'm not interested.</p> <p>In my current set of problems, I have trig functions or exp() and I need to execute them 352,800 times per second in real time (and use only a fraction of the CPU). So I plot the curve and use the data to drive the curve fitter to get less expensive approximations. In the old days, LUTs were almost always the solution, but nowadays skipping the memory lookups and doing an approximation is sometimes faster.</p>

Unfortunatly, those won't build in MSBuild and calling devenv.exe /build on 2008 just crashes, apparently it does that on all multi core computer (!!!). So now I have the choice to either rollback to .Net 2.0 and 2005 or simply ditch Visual Studio deployement, but first, I'd like a second opinion.</p> <p>Anyone knows of another automated way to build a .vdproj that will not require us to open the IDE and click on stuff?</p> <hr> <p>WiX was what I had in mind when saying we would ditch vdproj. Do you have any experience with it, good things, caveat?</p>

I started looking at <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/" rel="noreferrer">ActiveMQ</a> but don't know how well C# will hook with it. Wanting to hear what all of you guys think.</p> <p>edit : It is going to be a web application. Anything touching this foxpro is kinda slow (probably because the person who set it up 10 years ago messed it all to hell, some of the table files are incredibly large). We replicate the foxpro to sql nightly and most of our data reads are ok being a day old so we are focusing on the writes. plus the write affects a critical part of the user experience (purchasing), we store it in sql and then just message to have it put into foxpro when it can. I wish we could just get rid of the foxpro, unfortunately the company doesn't want to get rid of a very old piece of software they bought that depends on it.</p>

5087	0	Learning Ruby on Rails any good for Grails? <p>My company is in the process of starting down the <strong>Grails</strong> path. The reason for that is that the current developers are heavy on <strong>Java</strong> but felt the need for a <strong>MVC-style language</strong> for some future web development projects. Personally, I'm coming from the design/usability world, but as I take more "front-end" responsibilities I'm starting to feel the need for learning a language more intensively so I can code some logic but especially the front-end code for my UIs and stuff.</p> <p>I've been trying to get into <strong>Python/Django</strong> personally, but just never invested too much time on it. Now that my company is "jumping" into Grails I bought the "<em>Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd Ed - Beta)</em>" and I'm starting to get into <strong>RoR</strong>. I'd still like to learn <strong>Python</strong> in the future or on the side, but my biggest question is: </p> <ul> <li>Should I be learning RoR, and have a more versatile language in my "portfolio", knowing that my RoR knowledge will be useful for my Grails needs as well??</li> </ul> <p>-OR-</p> <ul> <li>Should I just skip RoR and focus on learning Grails that I'll be needing for work soon, and work on learning RoR/Django (Ruby/Python) later?</li> </ul> <p>Basically the question revolves around the usefulness of Grails in a non-corporate setting and the similarities between Rails and Grails. (and this, while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of Python vs Ruby (on Rails) :))</p>

5260	0	What is the best way to wrap time around the work day? <p>I have a situation where I want to add hours to a date and have the new date wrap around the work-day. I cobbled up a function to determine this new date, but want to make sure that I'm not forgetting anything.</p> <p>The hours to be added is called "delay". It could easily be a parameter to the function instead.</p> <p>Please post any suggestions. [VB.NET Warning]</p> <pre><code>Private Function GetDateRequired() As Date ''// A decimal representation of the current hour Dim hours As Decimal = Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Hour) + (Decimal.Parse(Date.Now.Minute) / 60.0) Dim delay As Decimal = 3.0 ''// delay in hours Dim endOfDay As Decimal = 12.0 + 5.0 ''// end of day, in hours Dim startOfDay As Decimal = 8.0 ''// start of day, in hours Dim newHour As Integer Dim newMinute As Integer Dim dateRequired As Date = Now Dim delta As Decimal = hours + delay ''// Wrap around to the next day, if necessary If delta &gt; endOfDay Then delta = delta - endOfDay dateRequired = dateRequired.AddDays(1) newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta)) newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60)) newHour = startOfDay + newHour Else newHour = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate(delta)) newMinute = Integer.Parse(Decimal.Truncate((delta - newHour) * 60)) End If dateRequired = New Date(dateRequired.Year, dateRequired.Month, dateRequired.Day, newHour, newMinute, 0) Return dateRequired End Sub </code></pre> <p><strong>Note</strong>: This will probably not work if delay is more than 9 hours long. It should never change from 3, through.</p> <p>EDIT: The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

The Solution</strong><br> lomaxx, thx for the <a href="http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PL/SQL_FAQ" rel="noreferrer">fiddler</a> tip. you have no idea how awesome it was to get that and use it as a debugging tool. after starting it up this is what i found and how i fixed it (at least in the short term):</p> <pre><code>&gt; ef Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:01:26 GMT dr_tm_w_0120.test_post: SIGNATURE (parameter names) MISMATCH VARIABLES IN FORM NOT IN PROCEDURE: SO1_DISPLAYED_,PO1_DISPLAYED_,RWA2_DISPLAYED_,DD1_DISPLAYED_ NON-DEFAULT VARIABLES IN PROCEDURE NOT IN FORM: 0 </code></pre> <p>After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the "<code>xxx_DISPLAYED_</code>" fields above were in it. </p> <p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web <code>PLSQL</code> code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of <code>IE6</code> for me, as Firefox worked fine.</p> <p>Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. </p>

6113	0	What is the best way to store connection string in .NET DLLs? <p>The application my team is currently developing has a DLL that is used to perform all database access. The application can not use a trusted connection because the database is behind a firewall and the domain server is not. So it appears that the connection string needs to have a DB username and password. The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open.</p> <p>One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base.</p> <p>Is there a way to store the password encrypted in such a way we can easily distribute to the entire user base without storing it in the assembly?</p> <p>UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who's answered. I'll try to answer some of the questions back to me... The data DLL is used by both ASP.NET WebForms and VB.NET WinForms. I understand that Applications can have their own config files, but I haven't seen anything on config files for DLLs. Unfortunately, I can't get to the Jon Galloway post at work so I can't judge if that will work. From a development standpoint, we don't want to use web services inhouse, but may be providing them to third parties sometime next year. I don't think impersonation will work because we can't authenticate the user through the firewall. As a user (or former user) can be an attacker, we're keeping it from everyone!</p>

6392	0	Java Time Zone is messed up <p>I am running a Tomcat application, and I need to display some time values. Unfortunately, the time is coming up an hour off. I looked into it and discovered that my default TimeZone is being set to:</p> <pre><code>sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id="GMT-08:00", offset=-28800000, dstSavings=0, useDaylight=false, transitions=0, lastRule=null] </code></pre> <p>Rather than the Pacific time zone. This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDisplayName()" rel="noreferrer">display name</a>, and it comes up "GMT-08:00", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone. I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p> <p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information? The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p> <hr> <p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p> <p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p> <hr> <p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem. As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings. My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone. Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up? I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

6658	0	JUnit vs TestNG <p>At work we are currently still using JUnit 3 to run our tests. We have been considering switching over to JUnit 4 for <strong>new</strong> tests being written but I have been keeping an eye on TestNG for a while now. What experiences have you all had with either JUnit 4 or TestNG, and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests? Having flexibility in writing tests is also important to us since our functional tests cover a wide aspect and need to be written in a variety of ways to get results.</p> <p>Old tests will not be re-written as they do their job just fine. What I would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written, natural assertions, grouping, and easily distributed test executions.</p>
6681	0	ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion <p>I'm still new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p> <p>Let's say I have a standard business object "Contact" in the <em>Business</em> namespace. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p> <p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a "Contact" and does some magic with it, like <code>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</code> say. Which of course takes the Contact of type <code>Business.Contact</code>.</p> <p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <code>BuyContactNewHat</code> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p> <pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact("Rob); Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here </code></pre> <p>Since the return type of <code>GetContact</code> is of <code>MyWebService.Contact</code> and not <code>Business.Contact</code> as expected. I understand why this is because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.</p> <p>So, is there an "easier" way to deal with this type of mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.</p>

If I use a fixed sprite non-vector image for the button background, then I can't size the button easily. If I write code to draw a resizable button (like Windows buttons are drawn), then the programmer has to get involved -- and it makes skinning difficult. Another option is to break the button into 9 smaller images (3x3) and stretch them all -- kindof like rounded corners are done in HTML. </p> <p>Is there another "easier" way?

I can use length() which tells me how many values there are, and I can use colSums(is.na(x)) to count the number of NA values, but colSums(is.numeric(x)) doesn't work the same way.</p> <p>I could use tapply with { length - number of NA values - number of blank values - number of text values } but surely there's an easier way.</p> <p>My data (I want to group by Nominal, and produce summary stats on Actual, LinPred and QualPred)</p> <pre><code>structure(list(Nominal = c(1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 50, 150, 250), Actual = c(NA, 0.422, 0.782, 1.25, 3.85, 6.94, 18.8, 31.2, 0.118, 0.361, 0.747, 1.18, 3.58, 5.82, 16.7, 29, 0.113, 0.382, 0.692, 1.12, 3.51, 5.43, 17.1, 28.7, 0.134, 0.402, 0.718, 1.25, 3.65, 6.52, NA, 28.8, 0.123, 0.396, 0.664, 1.12, 3.83, 5.6, NA, 28.1, 0.112, 0.341, 0.7, 1.08, 3.25, 5.97, NA, 27.1, 0.106, 0.35, 0.674, 1.14, 3.28, 5.5, 17.3, 30, 0.122, 0.321, 0.673, 1.22, 3.41, 5.85, 17.6, 28.1, 0.129, 0.351, 0.737, 1.06, 3.39, 5.53, 15.9, 28.5), LinPred = c(NA, 3.49519490135683, 6.4706724568458, 10.3387932789814, 31.8283534019573, 57.3678690865708, 155.393324109068, 257.881995464799, 0.982569410055046, 2.99101676001009, 6.18138991672881, 9.76022819874748, 29.5967452353405, 48.1108278028274, 138.036371702049, 239.698521514589, 0.941243332895477, 3.16458628408028, 5.72680306797355, 9.26431527283265, 29.0181801551066, 44.887393784381, 141.342457874815, 237.218956885015, 1.07941778099747, 3.36900393602722, 6.0686652233011, 10.6136646056736, 31.1174212178803, 55.6364968333108, NA, 245.979704049963, 0.98544222985819, 3.3177445444967, 5.60733069952645, 9.50304445584572, 32.6552029637958, 47.7767234652982, NA, 239.999441704736, 0.89146667871891, 2.8478667888003, 5.91488704870955, 9.1613151789756, 27.7001284491792, 50.9377192763467, NA, 231.456209782983, 0.887738051402174, 3.04188235451485, 5.9023034783202, 10.0163659588551, 28.9092709123842, 48.5084526866061, 152.684283738776, 264.805729023739, 1.02899341554071, 2.78585700701375, 5.89347501806154, 10.7226427795477, 30.0569707460098, 51.5984137771366, 155.332821816374, 248.031654532288, 1.09079263735132, 3.05071081477351, 6.45849647461568, 9.31008913816238, 29.8804015408367, 48.7733064943658, 140.324439376654, 251.563038635751 ), QuadPred = c(NA, 3.46077095737974, 6.38659713413108, 10.1956079501556, 31.4700369979564, 57.0089799611706, 157.775316006369, 268.303966059862, 0.99289436409299, 2.96536517477853, 6.10198249392715, 9.62549220297933, 29.2517496204359, 47.7196128593832, 139.600469198163, 248.272682787657, 0.95232583127381, 3.13590297331348, 5.65480031033985, 9.13693141349813, 28.6769820181676, 44.4936547741659, 143.050878627236, 245.555818447238, 1.08417831830729, 3.33895371044810, 6.00044125019758, 10.4882228621509, 30.8451526869812, 55.4331759085967, NA, 256.446833964951, 0.991679220421247, 3.28844923081897, 5.54540949253351, 9.3907657095483, 32.3793538902883, 47.5218142460371, NA, 249.828516445647, 0.899183876120787, 2.82554368740693, 5.84875388286628, 9.05319326862309, 27.4395572248486, 50.7001828907023, NA, 240.411024762687, 0.884412915928806, 3.05257006009469, 5.93046554432476, 10.0673979669, 29.0311859234644, 48.645035648271, 151.914544909710, 261.273991566153, 1.02660962824666, 2.79491765184684, 5.92158513760114, 10.7773327827008, 30.1813919027873, 51.7318741314584, 154.518856412401, 245.027488125567, 1.08881969774848, 3.06145444119556, 6.48990638077339, 9.35738460692028, 30.0044505131336, 48.9096796323938, 139.747394069421, 248.451100154569)), .Names = c("Nominal", "Actual", "LinPred", "QuadPred"), row.names = c(NA, -72L), class = "data.frame") </code></pre>

I want to be able to run them from the GUI without needing a terminal window to enter any input or view any output.</p> <p>So far the only input required is a password for sudo - and gksudo handles that fine. But I haven't found an easy way to show a message box yet. Is there some kind of 'gkmessage' command available? I'd prefer something present in a default Ubuntu install, but I don't mind installing a new package if necessary.</p>

Is it possible to do this without using Flash or is this the only real solution? I would like to keep it as cross-platform and standard as possible.</p>

7237	0	Does running a SQL Server 2005 database in compatibility level 80 have a negative impact on performance? <p>Our software must be able to run on SQL Server 2000 and 2005. To simplify development, we're running our SQL Server 2005 databases in compatibility level 80. However, database performance seems slower on SQL 2005 than on SQL 2000 in some cases (we have not confirmed this using benchmarks yet). Would upgrading the compatibility level to 90 improve performance on the SQL 2005 servers?</p>

I have seen the post on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/622/most-efficient-code-for-the-first-10000-prime-numbers">the most efficient way to find the first 10000 primes</a>. I'm looking for <strong>all possible ways</strong>. The goal is to have a one stop shop for primality tests. Any and all tests people know for finding prime numbers are welcome.</p> <p>And so:</p> <ul> <li><strong>What are all the different ways of finding primes?</strong></li> </ul>
7277	0	Is it "bad practice" to be sensitive to linebreaks in XML documents? <p>I'm generating some XML documents and when it comes to the address part I have fragments that look like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Address&gt;15 Sample St Example Bay Some Country&lt;/Address&gt; </code></pre> <p>The XSLT that I have for converting this to XHTML has some funky recursive template to convert newline characters within strings to &lt;br/&gt; tags.</p> <p>This is all working fine; but is it considered "bad practice" to rely on linebreaks within XML documents? If so, is it recommended that I do this instead?</p> <pre><code>&lt;Address&gt;&lt;Line&gt;15 Sample St&lt;/Line&gt; &lt;Line&gt;Example Bay&lt;/Line&gt; &lt;Line&gt;Some Country&lt;/Line&gt;&lt;/Address&gt; </code></pre> <p>Seems like it'd be really awkward to wrap every place where my text may be multiple lines with tags like that..</p>
7367	0	Visual Studio - new "default" property values for inherited controls <p>I'm looking for help setting a new default property value for an inherited control in Visual Studio:</p> <pre><code>class NewCombo : System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox { public NewCombo() { DropDownItems = 50; } } </code></pre> <p>The problem is that the base class property <code>DropDownItems</code> has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50). As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit <code>mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;</code> line.</p> <p>At first, this doesn't matter. But if later I change my inherited class to <code>DropDownItems = 45;</code> in the constructor, this does not affect any of the controls on any form since all those designer files still have the value 50 hard-coded in them. And the whole point was to have the value set in one place so I can deal with the customer changing his mind.</p> <p>Obviously, if I were creating my own custom property in the subclass, I could give it its own designer default attribute of whatever I wanted. But here I'm wanting to change the default values of properties in the base. Is there any way to apply Visual Studio attributes to a base class member? Or is there some other workaround to get the result I want?</p>

7489	0	How do I make a GUI? <p>I've made many different seperate parts of a GUI system for the Nintendo DS, like buttons and textboxes and select boxes, but I need a way of containing these classes in one Gui class, so that I can draw everything to the screen all at once, and check all the buttons at once to check if any are being pressed. My question is what is the best way organize all the classes (such as buttons and textboxes) into one GUI class?</p> <p>Here's one way I thought of but it doesn't seem right:</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm using C++.</p> <pre><code>class Gui { public: void update_all(); void draw_all() const; int add_button(Button *button); // Returns button id void remove_button(int button_id); private: Button *buttons[10]; int num_buttons; } </code></pre> <p>This code has a few problems, but I just wanted to give you an idea of what I want.</p>

1586744	1	Complex object initialization scope issues with nested functions <p>OK, so I'm trying to use S4 classes to build a very complex object, with slots including a half-dozen matrices, a few lists, and probably a kitchen sink or two in there. The object is initialized by referring to and unpacking a configuration object which I've already defined. It's easy enough to define the class with setClass(), but I'm having difficulty figuring out an elegant way of setting the slots in the setMethod("initialize"). </p> <p>The problem is that I need to set particular elements of those half-dozen matrices based on parts of that configuration object. For each element of the configuration object, I may have to set specific elements of several of the matrices. Note that the matrices are in the scope/environment of the initialize function. I then have nested functions within the initialize function that do the actual assignment to the matrices, or that's the idea anyway. Those functions can of course <em>see</em> the matrices, but they can't <em>modify</em> them because the &lt;- operator creates a new matrix if the original variable was not defined in the current environment. R is pass-by-value, and means it. This is even true for slots of the .Object I'm trying to initialize. So I can't use nested functions to do the initialization.</p> <p>Unfortunately, these nested functions have to modify several of the matrices, so returning values and doing the assignment in the main initialize function is not practical or elegant. (But it is possible, if I stuffed copies of the matrices into returned lists and then combined them in the main initialize function. Ugly though, and would require a lot of extra code.)</p> <p>And iteration (which would prevent this scoping issue) is not very practical either because of the hierarchical nature of the configuration object, which really wants to be traversed with recursive calls.</p> <p>The last option I can think of would be to use the assign() function with the envir option to force the assignment to apply to the nonlocal variable. But using environments like that seems icky, like a goto statement... </p> <p>So, what is the most piratical approach? Stick with pure functional programming and build ugly data structures just to inefficiently pass around redundant matrices? Try to find an iterative solution that avoids functions altogether? Use deep magic by playing with environments?</p>

I am guessing that it is trying to print to the console and that is why it is failing. </p> <p>Has anyone encountered a similar problem with R and <code>rapache</code>? I am relatively new to R and summary is doing a lot of things that are not directly exposed as functions so I am hoping I could get it to work</p> <p>Here is my r script</p> <pre><code>mydata &lt;- read.table("/home/user/test.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",") fit &lt;- lm(y~x1+x2+x3, data = mydata) setContentType("text/html") cat('&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;') cat(summary(fit)$adj.r.squared) cat('&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n') DONE </code></pre> <p>if i replace </p> <pre><code> cat(summary(fit)$adj.r.squared) </code></pre> <p>with this</p> <pre><code> cat(coef(fit)) </code></pre> <p>it is working!</p> <p>Thanks Bharani</p>

1661479	1	matplotlib for R user? <p>I regularly make figures (the exploratory data analysis type) in R. I also program in Python and was wondering if there are features or concepts in matplotlib that would be worth learning. For instance, I am quite happy with R - but its image() function will produce large files with pixelated output, whereas Matlab's equivalent figure (I also program regularly in Matlab) seems to be manageable in file size and also 'smoothed' - does matplotlib also provide such reductions...? But more generally, I wonder what other advantages matplotlib might confer. I don't mean this to be a trolling question. Thanks.</p>

Currently it appears like this</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in 0.062 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Occasionally I get rendered times like this</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in 0.000 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently it's only meant to be a guide for users to judge whether a page is quick to load or not, allowing them to quickly inform us if a page is taking 17 seconds rather than the usual 0.5. My question is what format should the time be in? At which point should I switch to a statement such as</p> <blockquote> <p>Rendered in less than a second</p> </blockquote> <p>I like seeing the tenths of a second but the second example above is of no use to anyone, in fact it just highlights the limits of the calculation I use to find the render time.

8704	0	Final managed exception handler in a mixed native/managed executable? <p>I have an MFC application compiled with /clr and I'm trying to implement a final handler for otherwise un-caught managed exceptions. For native exceptions, overriding <code>CWinApp::ProcessWndProcException</code> works.</p> <p>The two events suggested in Jeff's <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/exception/ExceptionHandling.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CodeProject article</a>,<code>Application.ThreadException</code> and <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException</code>, are not raised.</p> <p>Can anyone suggest a way to provide a final managed exception handler for a mixed executable?</p> <hr> <p>Update:</p> <p>It appears that these exception handlers are only triggered downstream of <code>Application.Run</code> or similar (there's a worker thread flavor, can't remember the name.) If you want to truly globally catch a managed exception you do need to install an SEH filter. You're not going to get a <code>System.Exception</code> and if you want a callstack you're going to have to roll your own walker.</p> <p>In an MSDN forum question on this topic it was suggested to override a sufficiently low-level point of the main MFC thread in a <code>try ... catch (Exception^)</code>. For instance, <code>CWinApp::Run</code>. This may be a good solution but I haven't looked at any perf or stability implications. You'll get a chance to log with a call stack before you bail and you can avoid the default windows unahndled exception behavior.</p>
8726	0	Checking FTP status codes with a PHP script <p>I have a script that checks responses from HTTP servers using the PEAR HTTP classes. However, I've recently found that the script fails on FTP servers (and probably anything that's not HTTP or HTTPS). I tried Google, but didn't see any scripts or code that returned the server status code from servers other than HTTP servers.</p> <p>How can I find out the status of a newsgroup or FTP server using PHP?</p> <p>EDIT: I should clarify that I am interested only in the ability to read from an FTP server and the directory that I specify.

8742	0	Getting accurate ticks from a timer in C# <p>I'm trying to rebuild an old metronome application that was originally written using MFC in C++ to be written in .NET using C#. One of the issues I'm running into is getting the timer to "tick" accurately enough.</p> <p>For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds). Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.</p> <p>Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick. This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.</p> <p>So, what is the best way to get accurate ticks? I know there are more timers available than the windows forms timer that is readily available in Visual Studio, but I'm not really familiar with them.</p>
8761	0	Find out which colours are in use when using the MFC Feature pack in Office 2007 style <p>I'm updating some of our legacy C++ code to use the "MFC feature pack" that Microsoft released for Visual Studio 2008. We've used the new classes to derive our application from CFrameWndEx, and are applying the Office 2007 styles to give our application a more modern appearance. This gives us gradient filled window titles, status bars etc, and the use of the ribbon toolbars.</p> <p>However, our application contains some owner drawn controls, and I'd like to update these to match the color scheme used by the feature pack. Ideally I'd like to know the light and shaded toolbar colors that are currently in use.</p> <p>I've had a hunt around the documentation and web and have not yet found anything. Does anyone know how to find this information out?</p> <p>[Edit]</p> <p>In particular we need to find out which colors are being used at runtime. You can change the appearance of your application at runtime using the new static function CMFCVisualManager::SetDefaultManager.</p> <p>The following msdn page shows you what kind of styles are available, in particular the Office2007 look: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc137831.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link to msdn</a></p>

9173	0	Lingering assembly dependency in C# .NET <p>My C# project - we'll call it the SuperUI - used to make use of a class from an external assembly. Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.</p> <p>This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the <code>SuperException</code> - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, <code>SuperAssembly.DLL</code>, which I referenced.</p> <p>Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all <code>SuperExceptions</code> with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:</p> <blockquote> <p>The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'</p> </blockquote> <p>The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.</p> <p>Now, here's the thing:</p> <ol> <li>All uses of <code>SuperException</code> have been eliminated from the project's code.</li> <li>Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, I only reference one more assembly - and <code>that</code> references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw <code>SuperExceptions</code>, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!</li> <li>I've done Visual Studio's "Clean Solution" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.</li> </ol> <p>It's not the end of the world to include this reference, I just don't see why it's necessary any more.

This mobile site will be in addition to the main site that we have already built for them. We've determined that the content is going to be a small subsection of the main site and will target the main audience that is expected to use the site.</p> <p>While looking through some sample mobile sites we noticed that a lot of site that have WAP in the url are actually just simplified HTML files. <a href="http://wap.mlb.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://wap.mlb.com</a> is not really WAP enabled but simple HTML.</p> <p>My question is WAP a think of the past? With smartphones and the iPhone having the ability to render sites as is do we need to worry about WML and WAP or will a stripped down html version be enough? </p> <p>Also can you recommend a blog or tutorial or answer below how best to check for mobile devices? Do we as the programmer need to know each variation of user agent in order to redirect them to our mobile site? </p> <p>Finally, would you program a mobile site for the iPhone/Touch Safari browser or just leave the site as is?</p>

9666	0	Is accessing a variable in C# an atomic operation? <p>I've been raised to believe that if multiple threads can access a variable, then all reads from and writes to that variable must be protected by synchronization code, such as a "lock" statement, because the processor might switch to another thread halfway through a write.</p> <p>However, I was looking through System.Web.Security.Membership using Reflector and found code like this:</p> <pre><code>public static class Membership { private static bool s_Initialized = false; private static object s_lock = new object(); private static MembershipProvider s_Provider; public static MembershipProvider Provider { get { Initialize(); return s_Provider; } } private static void Initialize() { if (s_Initialized) return; lock(s_lock) { if (s_Initialized) return; // Perform initialization... s_Initialized = true; } } } </code></pre> <p>Why is the s_Initialized field read outside of the lock?

10006	0	What is the easiest way to add compression to WCF in Silverlight? <p>I have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service. Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding. The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data. This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.). </p> <p>The request does have the "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?</p> <p>I did find this <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html" rel="noreferrer">link</a> but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.</p> <p>OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never "seem" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work. Well, as it turns out:</p> <ol> <li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along. It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working. My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it "under the covers" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response. I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application. In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li> <li><p>The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.</p></li> </ol> <p>So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.</p>

Not many jobs can truly offer that.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) I like the way it makes me think.. I look at EVERYTHING more logically as my skills improve.. This helps with general living as well as programming.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Money is/can be pretty good.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Its a pretty portable trade.. With collaboration tech as it is, you can pretty much work anywhere in the world so long as you have an Internet connection.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) It's an exciting industry to work in, theres massive amounts of tech to work and play with!</li> <li>(Quarrelsome) Jetpacks. Programming is Technology and the more time we spend with technology the closer we get to having Jetpacks.

Which can often reflect badly on all of us.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Not so sure about the initial cost.. Yeah you can get started with Java or something at low cost, but for me, locally, the vast demand is for .NET developers, which can be costly getting up and running with. However, this is rapidly/has not becoming the case with the amount of work put in by MS with releasing pretty damn good Express editions of their main development product line.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Its a lifelong career.. I truly feel you never really become a "master" by nature of the industry, you stop for 1-2 years. You're behind the times.. Some people do not like the pace.</li> <li>(Rob Cooper) Some geeks can be hard to work with.. While I think the general geek movement is really changing for the better, you will always have the classic "I am more intelligent than you" geeks that can really just be a pain in the ass for all!</li> <li>(Saj) Can cause virtual damage.</li> <li>(Saj) Can make one throw their computer away.</li> <li>(Saj) Can make one only virtually available to the world.</li> </ol>

10949	0	Unit tests for deep cloning <p>Let's say I have a complex .NET class, with lots of arrays and other class object members. I need to be able to generate a deep clone of this object - so I write a Clone() method, and implement it with a simple BinaryFormatter serialize/deserialize - or perhaps I do the deep clone using some other technique which is more error prone and I'd like to make sure is tested.</p> <p>OK, so now (ok, I should have done it first) I'd like write tests which cover the cloning. All the members of the class are private, and my architecture is so good (!) that I haven't needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessors. The class isn't IComparable or IEquatable, because that's not needed by the application. My unit tests are in a separate assembly to the production code.</p> <p>What approaches do people take to testing that the cloned object is a good copy? Do you write (or <em>rewrite</em> once you discover the need for the clone) all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with <em>either</em> a 'virgin' object <em>or</em> with a clone of it? How would you test if part of the cloning wasn't deep enough - as this is just the kind of problem which can give hideous-to-find bugs later?</p>

11060	0	How should I unit test a code-generator? <p>This is a difficult and open-ended question I know, but I thought I'd throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions.</p> <p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices. When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell. Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p> <p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all. That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p> <p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way. Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p> <p>Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share?</p>

11854	0	Inheritance and Polymorphism - Ease of use vs Purity <p>In a project our team is using object lists to perform mass operations on sets of data that should all be processed in a similar way. In particular, different objects would ideally act the same, which would be very easily achieved with polymorphism. The problem I have with it is that inheritance implies the <em>is a</em> relationship, rather than the <em>has a</em> relationship. For example, several objects <em>have a</em> damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an <em>is a</em> relationship which wouldn't be true. (A person <em>is not a</em> damage counter.)</p> <p>The only solution I can think of is to have a member of the class return the proper object type when implicitly casted instead of relying on inheritance. Would it be better to forgo the <em>is a</em> / <em>has a</em> ideal in exchange for ease of programming?</p> <p>Edit: To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to "act the same" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class. The use of an interface (or imitating them via inheritance) seems like a solution I would be willing to use.</p>

Use of period separator, e.g.</strong> </p> <pre><code> stock.prices &lt;- c(12.01, 10.12) col.names &lt;- c('symbol','price') </code></pre> <p><em>Pros:</em> Has historical precedence in the R community, prevalent throughout the R core, and recommended by <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml" rel="noreferrer">Google's R Style Guide</a>.</p> <p><em>Cons:</em> Rife with object-oriented connotations, and confusing to R newbies</p> <p><strong>2. Use of underscores</strong> </p> <pre><code> stock_prices &lt;- c(12.01, 10.12) col_names &lt;- c('symbol','price') </code></pre> <p><em>Pros:</em> A common convention in many programming langs; favored by <a href="http://had.co.nz/stat405/resources/r-style-guide.html" rel="noreferrer">Hadley Wickham's Style Guide</a>, and used in ggplot2 and plyr packages. </p> <p><em>Cons:</em> Not historically used by R programmers; is annoyingly mapped to '&lt;-' operator in Emacs-Speaks-Statistics (alterable with 'ess-toggle-underscore').</p> <p><strong>3. Use of mixed capitalization (camelCase)</strong></p> <pre><code> stockPrices &lt;- c(12.01, 10.12) colNames &lt;- c('symbol','price') </code></pre> <p><em>Pros:</em> Appears to have wide adoption in several language communities.</p> <p><em>Cons:</em> Has recent precedent, but not historically used (in either R base or its documentation).</p> <p>Finally, as if it weren't confusing enough, I ought to point out that the Google Style Guide argues for dot notation for variables, but mixed capitalization for functions.</p> <p>The lack of consistent style across R packages is problematic on several levels. From a developer standpoint, it makes maintaining and extending other's code difficult (esp. where its style is inconsistent with your own). From a R user standpoint, the inconsistent syntax steepens R's learning curve, by multiplying the ways a concept might be expressed (e.g. is that date casting function asDate(), as.date(), or as_date()? No, it's as.Date()).</p>

1982667	1	Standard error of the ARIMA constant <p>I am trying to manually calculate the standard error of the constant in an ARIMA model, if it is included. I have referred to Box and Jenkins (1994) text, specially Section 7.2, but my understanding is that the methods mentioned here calculates the variance-covariance matrix for the ARIMA parameters only, not the constant. Tried searching on the Internet, but couldn't find any theory. Software like Minitab, R etc. calculate this, so I was wondering what is the way? Can someone provide any pointer(s) on this topic?

13518	0	Browser Sync across many machines <p>Everyone remembers google browser sync right? I thought it was great. Unfortunately Google decided not to upgrade the service to Firefox 3.0. Mozilla is developing a replacement for google browser sync which will be a part of the Weave project. I have tried using Weave and found it to be very very slow or totally inoperable. Granted they are in a early development phase right now so I can not really complain. </p> <p>This specific problem of browser sync got me to thinking though. What do all of you think of Mozilla or someone making a server/client package that we, the users, could run on your 'main' machine? Now you just have to know your own IP or have some way to announce it to your client browsers at work or wherever.</p> <p>There are several problems I can think of with this: non static IPs, Opening up ports on your local comp etc. It just seems that Mozilla does not want to handle this traffic created by many people syncing their browsers. There is not a way for them to monetize this traffic since all the data uploaded must be encrypted. </p>

13678	0	Textual versus Graphical Programming Languages <p>I am part of a high school robotics team, and there is some debate about which language to use to program our robot. We are choosing between C (or maybe C++) and LabVIEW. There are pros for each language.</p> <p>C(++):</p> <ul> <li>Widely used</li> <li>Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)</li> <li>We can expand upon our C codebase from last year</li> <li>Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.</li> </ul> <p>LabVIEW</p> <ul> <li>Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)</li> <li>Easier to teach (Supposedly...)</li> <li>"The future of programming is graphical." (Think so?)</li> <li>Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.</li> <li>Don't need to intimately know what's going on. Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.</li> </ul> <p>This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while. Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, <strong>what do you think the better option is?</strong> Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.

I'd really like to hear your opinions. <strong>Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a "while box?"</strong> <strong>Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?</strong></p> <p>Thanks again!</p> <hr> <p>Edit: I just realized that this falls under the topic of "language debate."

You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.</p> <p><strong>Possible Answers</strong></p> <p>My idea is this: </p> <p>You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.</p> <p>Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.</p> <p>Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.</p>

There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously. However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant. I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.</li> </ol> <p>I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.</p> <p>Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?

I have the following script, and as of the second to last line I have the data in the format:</p> <pre><code>&gt; names(data) [1] "VisitWeek" "ThingAge" "MyMetric" </code></pre> <p>VisitWeek is a Date. ThingAge and MyMetric are integers.</p> <p>The data looks like:</p> <pre><code>2010-02-07 49 12345 </code></pre> <p>The script I have so far is:</p> <pre><code># Load ggplot2 for charting library(ggplot2); # Our file has headers - column names data = read.table('weekly_cohorts.tsv',header=TRUE,sep="\t"); # Print the names names(data) # Convert to dates data$VisitWeek = as.Date(data$VisitWeek) data$ThingCreation = as.Date(data$ThingCreation) # Fill in the age column data$ThingAge = as.integer(data$VisitWeek - data$ThingCreation) # Filter data to thing ages lt 10 weeks (70 days) + a sanity check for gt 0, and drop the creation week column data = subset(data, data$ThingAge &lt;= 70, c("VisitWeek","ThingAge","MyMetric")) data = subset(data, data$ThingAge &gt;= 0) print(ggplot(data, aes(x=VisitWeek, y=MyMetric, fill=ThingAge)) + geom_area()) </code></pre> <p>This last line does not work. I've tried lots of variations, bars, histograms, but as usual R docs defeat me.</p> <p>I want it to show a standard Excel style stacked area chart - one time series for each ThingAge stacked across the weeks in the x axis, with the date on the y axis. An example of this kind of chart is here: <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Mk_Zuwanderer.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Mk_Zuwanderer.png</a></p> <p>I've read the docs here: <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_area.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_area.html</a> and <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html</a> and this blog <a href="http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/r-lattice-plot-beats-excel-stacked-area-trend-chart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/r-lattice-plot-beats-excel-stacked-area-trend-chart/</a> but I can't quite make it work for me.</p> <p>How can I achieve this?</p>
15254	0	Can placement new for arrays be used in a portable way? <p>Is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays?</p> <p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p> <p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; class A { public: A() : data(0) {} virtual ~A() {} int data; }; int main() { const int NUMELEMENTS=20; char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)]; A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS]; // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer printf("Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n", pBuffer, pA); // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption delete[] pBuffer; return 0; } </code></pre> <p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p> <p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

One of them is floated right. The problem is that the margin-bottom is not getting the full 19px in IE7. I've gone through all of the IE7 css/margin/float bugs that I can think of and have tried remedies but have been unsuccessful. I have been googling for a while now and cannot find anything that is helping out. </p> <p>Here is what I have tried. </p> <ol> <li>Wrapping the form or fieldset in an unstyled div. No apparent change.</li> <li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and instead wrapping that with a div and giving it a padding-bottom of 19px. No apparent change.</li> <li>Nixing the margin-bottom on the table and adding a div with a fixed height of 19px. No apparent change.</li> <li>Putting a clear between the table and the fieldset.</li> </ol> <p>I know there are some others that I am forgetting, but those are the things I have tried out recently. This happens to each fieldset. </p> <hr> <p>I am using a reset style sheet and have a xhtml transitional doctype. </p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also have the IE7 web developer toolbar and Firebug.

15805	0	Why are my auto-run applications acting weird on Vista? <p>The product we are working on allows the user to easily set it up to run automatically whenever the computer is started. This is helpful because the product is part of the basic work environment of most of our users.<br> This feature was implemented not so long ago and for a while all was well, but when we started testing this feature on Vista the product started behaving really weird on startup. Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).</p> <p>This happens whenever we run our product by registering it in the "Run" key in the registry or place a shortcut to it in the "<em>Startup</em>" folder inside the "<em>Start Menu</em>", even when we put a delay of ~20 seconds before actually starting to run. When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.</p> <p>We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.</p> <p>Now how is it possible that applications that run normally a minute after logon report such hard errors when starting immediately after logon?</p>

16434	0	How to test numerical analysis routines? <p>Are there any good online resources for how to create, maintain and think about writing test routines for numerical analysis code?</p> <p>One of the limitations I can see for something like testing matrix multiplication is that the obvious tests (like having one matrix being the identity) may not fully test the functionality of the code.</p> <p>Also, there is the fact that you are usually dealing with large data structures as well. Does anyone have some good ideas about ways to approach this, or have pointers to good places to look?</p>
2321786	1	Best way to store variable-length data in an R data.frame? <p>I have some mixed-type data that I would like to store in an R data structure of some sort. Each data point has a set of fixed attributes which may be 1-d numeric, factors, or characters, and also a set of variable length data. For example:</p> <pre><code>id phrase num_tokens token_lengths 1 "hello world" 2 5 5 2 "greetings" 1 9 3 "take me to your leader" 4 4 2 2 4 6 </code></pre> <p>The actual values are not all computable from one another, but that's the flavor of the data. The operations I'm going to want to do include subsetting the data based on boolean functions (e.g. something like <code>nchar(data$phrase) &gt; 10</code> or <code>lapply(data$token_lengths, length) &gt; 2)</code>. I'd also like to index and average values in the variable length portion by index. This doesn't work, but something like: <code>mean(data$token_lengths[1], na.rm=TRUE))</code></p> <p>I've found I can shoehorn "token_lengths" into a data.frame by making it an array:</p> <pre><code>d &lt;- data.frame(id=c(1,2,3), ..., token_lengths=as.array(list(c(5,5), 9, c(4,2,2,4,6))) </code></pre> <p>But is this the best way?</p>

16483	0	Convince Firefox to send an If-Modified-Since header over HTTPS <p>How can I convince Firefox (3.0.1, if it matters) to send an If-Modified-Since header in an HTTPS request? It sends the header if the request uses plain HTTP and my server dutifully honors it. But when I request the same resource from the same server using HTTPS instead (i.e., simply changing the http:// in the URL to https://) then Firefox does not send an If-Modified-Since header at all. Is this behavior mandated by the SSL spec or something?</p> <p>Here are some example HTTP and HTTPS request/response pairs, pulled using the Live HTTP Headers Firefox extension, with some differences in bold:</p> <p>HTTP request/response:</p> <pre>http://myserver.com:30000/scripts/site.js GET /scripts/site.js HTTP/1.1 Host: myserver.com:30000 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (...)

Adding a "Cache-control: public" header to the response also worked. Thanks!</p>
2329036	1	How to reference columns of a data.frame within a data.frame? <p>I have a data.frame called series_to_plot.df which I created by combining a number of other data.frames together (shown below). I now want to pull out just the .mm column from each of these, so I can plot them. So I want to pull out the 3rd column of each data.frame (e.g. p3c3.mm, p3c4.mm etc...), but I can't see how to do this for all data.frames in the object without looping through the name. Is this possible?</p> <p>I can pull out just one set: e.g. series_to_plot.df[[3]] and another by series_to_plot.df[[10]] (so it is just a list of vectors..) and I can reference directly with series_to_plot.df$p3c3.mm, but is there a command to get a vector containing all mm's from each data.frame?

17299	0	How can I sort an array of double pointers based on the values they point to? <p>I am trying to build a function in C/C++ to sort an array and replace each value with its "score" or rank. It takes in a double pointer array to an array of ints, and sorts the double pointers based on the dereferenced value of the integers. I have tried quite a few times to make it work, but can't get it down. Once again, it must sort the double pointers based on the values they point to. This is what I have:</p> <pre><code>void SortArray( int ** pArray, int ArrayLength ) { int i, j, flag = 1; // set flag to 1 to begin initial pass int * temp; // holding variable orig with no * for(i = 1; (i &lt;= ArrayLength) &amp;&amp; flag; i++) { flag = 0; for (j = 0; j &lt; (ArrayLength -1); j++) { if (*pArray[j+1] &gt; *pArray[j]) // ascending order simply changes to &lt; { temp = &amp;pArray[j]; // swap elements pArray[j] = &amp;pArray[j+1]; pArray[j+1] = &amp;temp; flag = 1; // indicates that a swap occurred. } } } } </code></pre>

17500	0	Why are DispatcherObject.CheckAccess() and VerifyAccess() hidden from Intellisense? <p>The <code>System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject</code> class (which <code>DependencyObject</code> is based on) contains a useful function, called <code>CheckAccess()</code>, that determines whether or not the code is running on the UI thread.</p> <p>When I wanted to use it yesterday, I was puzzled to find out that Intellisense didn't show the function (nor <code>VerifyAccess()</code>, which throws an exception when not on the UI thread), even though the MSDN library lists it. I decided to investigate the class using Reflector. It seems that the function in question has an <code>EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)</code> attribute attached to it. The <code>Dispatcher</code> class, which is used by <code>DispatcherObject</code>, has the same attribute attached to <code>CheckAccess()</code> and <code>VerifyAccess()</code>:</p> <pre><code>public abstract class DispatcherObject { // ... [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] public bool CheckAccess(); [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] public void VerifyAccess(); // ... [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)] public Dispatcher Dispatcher { get; } } public sealed class Dispatcher { // ... [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] public bool CheckAccess(); [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] public void VerifyAccess(); // ... } </code></pre> <p>I don't believe that the application of that attribute is random (or a joke), so my question is: why is it there? Should those methods not be called directly? Then why aren't they <code>protected</code> (or <code>internal</code>, like some of the most useful methods in the WPF)?</p>

Also, should the files be stored in context-related locations on the server, or all together?</p> <p>Some examples: user profile photos, job application CVs, related documents on CMS pages, etc.</p>

We are developing a commercial product which (currently) depends on MySQL as a database back-end. Their license states we need to pay them a percentage of our list price per installation, and not a flat fee. As a startup, this is less than appealing.</p>
17732	0	When should assertions stay in production code? <p>There's a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/browse_thread/thread/8e0235d58c8635c2" rel="noreferrer" title="assertions: does it matter that they are disabled in production?">discussion</a> going on over at comp.lang.c++.moderated about whether or not assertions, which in C++ only exist in debug builds by default, should be kept in production code or not.</p> <p>Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is <strong>not</strong> so much <strong>whether</strong> assertions should be kept, <strong>but in which cases</strong> this is recommendable/not a good idea.</p> <p>By assertion, I mean:</p> <ul> <li>A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software.</li> <li>A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work).</li> </ul> <p>I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++.</p> <p>My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix.</p> <p>What's your opinion/experience?</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Carl</p> <p>See related question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419406/are-assertions-good">here</a></p> <hr> <p><strong>Responses and Updates</strong></p> <p>Hey Graham,</p> <blockquote> <p>An assertion is error, pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one. Since an error should be handled in release mode then you don't really need assertions.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's why I prefer the word "bug" when talking about assertions. It makes things much clearer. To me, the word "error" is too vague. A missing file is an error, not a bug, and the program should deal with it. Trying to dereference a null pointer is a bug, and the program should acknowledge that something smells like bad cheese.</p> <p>Hence, you should test the pointer with an assertion, but the presence of the file with normal error-handling code.</p> <hr> <p>Slight off-topic, but an important point in the discussion.</p> <p>As a heads-up, if your assertions break into the debugger when they fail, why not. But there are plenty of reasons a file could not exist that are completely outside of the control of your code: read/write rights, disk full, USB device unplugged, etc. Since you don't have control over it, I feel assertions are not the right way to deal with that.</p> <p>Carl</p> <hr> <p>Thomas,</p> <p>Yes, I have Code Complete, and must say I strongly disagree with that particular advice.</p> <p>Say your custom memory allocator screws up, and zeroes a chunk of memory that is still used by some other object. I happens to zero a pointer that this object dereferences regularly, and one of the invariants is that this pointer is never null, and you have a couple of assertions to make sure it stays that way. What do you do if the pointer suddenly is null. You just if() around it, hoping that it works?</p> <p>Remember, we're talking about product code here, so there's no breaking into the debugger and inspecting the local state. This is a real bug on the user's machine.</p> <p>Carl</p>

I'm using a <code>URLLoader</code> to load a XML file, and upon <code>Event.COMPLETE</code> creating a new XML object. 75% of the time this work fine, and every now and again I get this type of exception:</p> <pre><code>TypeError: Error #1085: The element type "link" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "&lt;/link&gt;". </code></pre> <p>We think the problem is that The XML is large, and perhaps the <code>Event.COMPLETE</code> event is fired before the XML is actually downloaded from the <code>URLLoader</code>. The only solution we have come up with is to set off a timer upon the Event, and essentially "wait a few seconds" before beginning to parse the data. Surely this can't be the best way to do this.</p> <p>Is there any surefire way to parse XML within Flash?</p> <p><strong>Update Sept 2 2008</strong> We have concluded the following, the excption is fired in the code at this point:</p> <pre><code>data = new XML(mainXMLLoader.data); // calculate the total number of entries. for each (var i in data.channel.item){ _totalEntries++; } </code></pre> <p>I have placed a try/catch statement around this part, and am currently displaying an error message on screen when it occurs. My question is how would an incomplete file get to this point if the <code>bytesLoaded == bytesTotal</code>?</p> <hr> <p>I have updated the original question with a status report; I guess another question could be is there a way to determine wether or not an <code>XML</code> object is properly parsed before accessing the data (in case the error is that my loop counting the number of objects is starting before the XML is actually parsed into the object)?</p> <hr> <p>@Theo: Thanks for the ignoreWhitespace tip. Also, we have determined that the event is called before its ready (We did some tests tracing <code>mainXMLLoader.bytesLoaded + "/" + mainXMLLoader.bytesLoaded</code></p>

I have one concern though. The script that increments the version number... it can not be intelligent enough to increment Major number etc. right. e.g. if one of the utils has version 1.2.3 and we are at a point where the new version is 2.0.0. The script may not be able to handle this. </p> <p>I think this has to do a lot with our branching techniques -- we don't have any.

No need to tell this is a very unfortunate behaviour.</p> <pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e) { // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler throw new Exception("OMG!"); } </code></pre> <p>The code above will cancel navigation and swallow the exception.</p> <pre><code>void webBrowserNavigating(object sender, WebBrowserNavigatingEventArgs e) { // WebBrowser.Navigating event handler try { e.Cancel = true; if (actions.ContainsKey(e.Url.ToString())) { actions[e.Url.ToString()].Invoke(e.Url, webBrowser.Document); } } catch (Exception exception) { MessageBox.Show(exception.ToString()); } } </code></pre> <p>So, what I do (above) is catch all exceptions and pop a box, this is better than silently failing but still clearly far from ideal. I'd like it to redirect the exception through the normal application failure path so that it ultimately becomes unhandled, or handled by the application from the root.</p> <p>Is there any way to tell the <code>WebBrowser</code> control to stop sinking the exceptions and just forward them the natural and expected way? Or is there some hacky way to throw an exception through native boundaries?</p>
18077	0	The best way of checking for -moz-border-radius support <p>I wanted some of those spiffy rounded corners for a web project that I'm currently working on.</p> <p>I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly.</p> <p>I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/corners" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rounded corners plugin</a> and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs.</p> <p>I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific <code>-moz-border-radius-*</code> properties and if so utilize them.</p> <p>The check for webkit support looks like this:</p> <pre><code>var webkitAvailable = false; try { webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined); } catch(err) {} </code></pre> <p>That, however, did not work for <code>-moz-border-radius</code> so I started checking for alternatives.</p> <p>My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse.</p> <p>My best solution yet is as follows.</p> <pre><code>var mozborderAvailable = false; try { var o = jQuery('&lt;div&gt;').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px'); mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px'; o = null; } catch(err) {} </code></pre> <p>It's based on the theory that Gecko "expands" the composite -moz-border-radius to the four sub-properties</p> <ul> <li><code>-moz-border-radius-topleft</code></li> <li><code>-moz-border-radius-topright</code></li> <li><code>-moz-border-radius-bottomleft</code></li> <li><code>-moz-border-radius-bottomright</code></li> </ul> <p>Is there any javascript/CSS guru out there that have a better solution?</p> <p>(The feature request for this page is at <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/node/3619" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://plugins.jquery.com/node/3619</a>)</p>

18216	0	Query a union table with fields as columns <p>I'm not quite sure if this is possible, or falls into the category of pivot tables, but I figured I'd go to the pros to see.</p> <p>I have three basic tables: Card, Property, and CardProperty. Since cards do not have the same properties, and often multiple values for the same property, I decided to use the union table approach to store data instead of having a really big column structure in my card table.</p> <p>The property table is a basic keyword/value type table. So you have the keyword ATK and the value assigned to it. There is another property called SpecialType which a card can have multiple values for, such as "Sycnro" and "DARK"</p> <p>What I'd like to do is create a view or stored procedure that gives me the Card Id, Card Name, and all the property keywords assigned to the card as columns and their values in the ResultSet for a card specified. So ideally I'd have a result set like:</p> <pre><code>ID NAME SPECIALTYPE 1 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro 1 Red Dragon Archfiend DARK 1 Red Dragon Archfiend Effect </code></pre> <p>and I could tally my results that way.</p> <p>I guess even slicker would be to simply concatenate the properties together based on their keyword, so I could generate a ResultSet like:</p> <pre><code>1 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro/DARK/Effect </code></pre> <p>..but I don't know if that's feasible.</p> <p>Help me stackoverflow Kenobi!

Due to my quite modest LaTeX abilities, only a user-friendly (and noob-friendly) interface should suffice. Here's a <a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/Rreport" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> to an official website. I'm following the instructions, but I cannot manage to install an app. I use Ubuntu 9.10, R version is 2.10.1 (updated regularly from UCLA's CRAN server), and of course, cvs is installed on my system.</p> <p>Now, I'd like to know if there is some user-friendly LaTeX template package (Sweave is still to advanced/spartan for me). I'm aware that my question is quite confounding, but a brief glance on examples on Rreport page should give you a hint. I'm aware that LaTeX skills are a must, but just for now I need something that will suit my needs (as a psychological researcher).</p> <p>Is there any package similar with Rreport?</p>

In which case, I'll need to ignore one of the inner stems...</p> <p><strong>Q: How long are these strings that you want to parse?</strong> A: Each string has between 60 to 150 characters (and I have tens of thousands of them...)</p> <p><strong>Q: Is each one a self contained sequence like you show in your example, or do they go on for thousands of characters?</strong> A: each sequence is self contained.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is there always at least one '.' between stems?</strong><br> A: No.</p> <p><strong>Q: A full set of rules as to how the parsing should be done would be useful.</strong> A: I agree.

18984	0	What do you think of developing for the command line first? <p>What are your opinions on developing for the command line first, then adding a GUI on after the fact by simply calling the command line methods?</p> <p>eg.</p> <blockquote> <p>W:\ todo AddTask "meeting with John, re: login peer review" "John's office" "2008-08-22" "14:00" </p> </blockquote> <p>loads <code>todo.exe</code> and calls a function called <code>AddTask</code> that does some validation and throws the meeting in a database. </p> <p>Eventually you add in a screen for this: </p> <pre> ============================================================ Event: [meeting with John, re: login peer review] Location: [John's office] Date: [Fri. Aug. 22, 2008] Time: [ 2:00 PM] [Clear] [Submit] ============================================================ </pre> <p>When you click submit, it calls the same AddTask function.</p> <p>Is this considered: </p> <ul> <li>a good way to code</li> <li>just for the newbies</li> <li>horrendous!.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> </p> <p>I'm noticing a trend here for "shared library called by both the GUI and CLI executables." Is there some compelling reason why they would have to be separated, other than maybe the size of the binaries themselves? </p> <p>Why not just call the same executable in different ways:</p> <ul> <li><code>"todo /G"</code> when you want the full-on graphical interface</li> <li><code>"todo /I"</code> for an interactive prompt <em>within</em> <code>todo.exe</code> (scripting, etc)</li> <li>plain old <code>"todo &lt;function&gt;"</code> when you just want to do one thing and be done with it.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> </p> <p>It was mentioned that "the way [I've] described things, you [would] need to spawn an executable every time the GUI needs to do something." </p> <p>Again, this wasn't my intent. When I mentioned that the example GUI called "the same <code>AddTask</code> function," I didn't mean the GUI called the command line program each time. I agree that would be totally nasty. I had intended (see first addendum) that this all be held in a single executable, since it was a tiny example, but I don't think my phrasing necessarily precluded a shared library.</p> <p>Also, I'd like to thank all of you for your input.

So, something like the following (made up data, etc.). Q1, Q2, and Q3 each have either a 1, a 2, or a 3 for each person. I just left these as numbers, but they could be factors, neither seemed to help solve the problem.</p> <pre> 1 (very Often) 2 (Rarely) 3 (Never) Q1. Likes it 12 15 13 Q2. Recommends it 22 11 10 Q3. Used it 22 12 9 </pre> <p>In SPSS, one can even request row, column, or total percentages.</p> <p>I've tried table(), ftable(), xtab(), CrossTable() from gmodels, and CrossTable() from descr, and none of these can handle (afaik) multiple variables; they mostly seem to handle 1 variable crossed with another variable, and the 3rd creates layers.</p> <p>Is there a package with some good cross tabbing/table examples that I could use to figure this out? I'm sure I'm missing something simple, so I appreciate you pointing out what I missed. Perhaps I have to generate each row as a separate list and then make a dataframe and print the dataframe?</p> <p>UPDATE: I've now discovered ctab() in package catspec, which is also on the right track. It's interesting that R has no consistent equivalent to Ctables in SPSS, which is basically a "tabbing" tool ala the old tabulate tools used for survey research. ctab() is trying, and is an admirable 1st step... but you still can't make this table (above) with it.</p>

2486130	1	Programming R/Sweave for proper \Sexpr output <p>I'm having a bit of a problem programming R for Sweave, and the #rstats twitter group often points here, so I thought I'd put this question to the SO crowd. I'm an analyst- not a programmer- so go easy on my first post. </p> <p>Here's the problem: I am drafting a survey report in Sweave with R and would like to report the marginal returns in line using <code>\Sexpr{}</code>. For example, rather than saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only 14% of respondents said 'X'.</p> </blockquote> <p>I want to write the report like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Only \Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}$\%$ of respondents said 'X'. </p> </blockquote> <p>The problem is that Sweave converts the results of the expression in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> to a character string, which means that the output from the expression in R and the output that appears in my document are different. For example, above I use the function 'p.mean':</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>p.mean&lt;- function (x) {options(digits=1) mmm&lt;-weighted.mean(x, weight=weight, na.rm=T) print(100*mmm) } </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>In R, the output looks like this:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>p.mean(variable) &gt;14 </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>but when I use <code>\Sexpr{p.mean(variable)}</code>, I get an unrounded character string (in this case: 13.5857142857143) in my document. I have tried to limit the output of my function to <code>digits=1</code> in the global environment, in the function itself, and and in various commands. It only seems to contain what R prints, not the character transformation that is the result of the expression and which eventually prints in the LaTeX file. </p> <blockquote> <pre><code>as.character(p.mean(variable)) &gt;[1] 14 &gt;[1] "13.5857142857143" </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>Does anyone know what I can do to limit the digits printed in the LaTeX file, either by reprogramming the R function or with a setting in Sweave or <code>\Sexpr{}</code>?</p>

In my opinion it is:</p> <ol> <li>Overly complex, especially for use within web apps (all that threaded runtime stuff)</li> <li>Immature (ever worked with that horrible designer?)</li> <li>Anemic in its current feature set</li> </ol> <p>Does anyone have a suggestion for a better .NET based workflow framework? Specifically, I am looking for the following features:</p> <ol> <li>State machine based (mapping states to available actions)</li> <li>A focus on user permissions (controlling who has access to what actions)</li> <li>The ability to run workflows as timed background tasks (for example, to send out reminders for items that have been sitting in a certain state for x days)</li> </ol> <p>That's really all I need.

(It's for a multiple regression analysis stats class that I'm loving at the moment :-)</p> <p>My textbook (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken 2003) recommends plotting each predictor against the residuals to make sure that:</p> <ol> <li>The residuals don't systematically covary with the predictor</li> <li>The residuals are homoscedastic with respect to each predictor in the model</li> </ol> <p>On point (2), my textbook has this to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Some statistical packages allow the analyst to plot lowess fit lines at the mean of the residuals (0-line), 1 standard deviation above the mean, and 1 standard deviation below the mean of the residuals....In the present case {their example}, the two lines {mean + 1sd and mean - 1sd} remain roughly parallel to the lowess {0} line, consistent with the interpretation that the variance of the residuals does not change as a function of X. (p. 131)</p> </blockquote> <h3>How can I modify loess lines?</h3> <p>I know how to generate a scatterplot with a "0-line,":</p> <pre><code> # First, I'll make a simple linear model and get its diagnostic stats library(ggplot2) data(cars) mod &lt;- fortify(lm(speed ~ dist, data = cars)) attach(mod) str(mod) # Now I want to make sure the residuals are homoscedastic qplot (x = dist, y = .resid, data = mod) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) # "se = FALSE" Removes the standard error bands </code></pre> <p>But does anyone know how I can use <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>qplot</code> to generate plots where the 0-line, "mean + 1sd" AND "mean - 1sd" lines would be superimposed? Is that a weird/complex question to be asking?</p>
20034	0	Is Project Darkstar Realistic? <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Darkstar" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Project Darkstar</a> was the topic of the monthly <a href="http://www.javasig.com/meeting/home.xhtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaSIG</a> meeting down at the Google offices in NYC last night. For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the "hard stuff." The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks. You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p> <p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications. Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write. He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so. This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p> <p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it. First, you have to write your server code in Java. The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java. Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p> <p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves. Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce. Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p> <p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time? Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required? Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>
20047	0	Diagnosing Deadlocks in SQL Server 2005 <p>We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database.</p> <p>I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/" rel="noreferrer">this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks</a>, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that <strong>the deadlocking write is <em>always</em> the same</strong>:</p> <pre><code>UPDATE [dbo].[Posts] SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3 WHERE [Id] = @p0 </code></pre> <p>The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple <strong>read</strong> of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example</p> <pre><code>SELECT [t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], [t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], [t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason], [t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId] FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0] WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0 </code></pre> <p>To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.</p> <p>We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added <code>with (nolock)</code> to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!</p> <p>Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.</p> <p>The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's <em>only</em> executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.</p> <p>I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?</p> <p>Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Scott Hanselman discusses here</a>.</p> <p>We are flirting with the idea of using</p> <pre><code>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED </code></pre> <p>on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.</p> <p>I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but <em>reads?</em> We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.</p> <p>Ideas? Thoughts?</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?</p> </blockquote> <p>Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part:</p> <pre><code>private DBContext _db; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public DBContext DB { get { if (_db == null) { _db = new DBContext() { SessionName = GetType().Name }; //_db.ExecuteCommand("SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED"); } return _db; } } </code></pre> <p>Do you recommend we create a new context for every Controller, or per Page, or .. more often?</p>
20148	0	MyISAM versus InnoDB <p>I'm working on a projects which involves a lot of database writes, I'd say (<em>70% inserts and 30% reads</em>). This ratio would also include updates which I consider to be one read and one write. The reads can be dirty (e.g. I don't need 100% accurate information at the time of read).<br> The task in question will be doing over 1 million database transactions an hour. </p> <p>I've read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB, and MyISAM seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database/tables that I'll be using for this task. From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported.</p> <p>Does anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)? Is MyISAM the way to go?</p>

20321	0	One database or many? <p>I am developing a website that will manage data for multiple entities. No data is shared between entities, but they may be owned by the same customer. A customer may want to manage all their entities from a single "dashboard". So should I have one database for everything, or keep the data seperated into individual databases? Is there a best-practice? What are the positives/negatives for having a:</p> <ul> <li>database for the entire site (entity has a "customerID", data has "entityID")</li> <li>database for each customer (data has "entityID")</li> <li>database for each entity (relation of database to customer is outside of database)</li> </ul> <p>Multiple databases seems like it would have better performance (fewer rows and joins) but may eventually become a maintenance nightmare.</p>

20511	0	How do you unit test web apps hosted remotely? <p>I'm familiar with TDD and use it in both my workplace and my home-brewed web applications. However, every time I have used TDD in a web application, I have had the luxury of having full access to the web server. That means that I can update the server then run my unit tests directly from the server. My question is, if you are using a third party web host, how do you run your unit tests on them?</p> <p>You could argue that if your app is designed well and your build process is sound and automated, that running unit tests on your production server isn't necessary, but personally I like the peace of mind in knowing that everything is still "green" after a major update.</p> <hr> <p>For everyone who has responded with "just test before you deploy" and "don't you have a staging server?", I understand where you're coming from. I do have a staging server and a CI process set up. My unit tests do run and I make sure they all pass before an an update to production. </p> <p>I realize that in a perfect world I wouldn't be concerned with this. But I've seen it happen before. If a file is left out of the update or a SQL script isn't run, the effects are immediately apparent when running your unit tests but can go unnoticed for quite some time without them.</p> <p>What I'm asking here is if there is any way, if only to satisfy my own compulsive desires, to run a unit test on a server that I cannot install applications on or remote into (e.g. one which I will only have FTP access to in order to update files)?</p>

Some people argue that model-driven approaches will be The Next Big Thing. There are tools like openArchitectureWare, AndroMDA, Sculptor/Fornax Platform etc. that promise incredible productivity boosts. However, I made the experience that it is either rather easy in the beginning to get started but as well to get stuck at some point when you try something that was unanticipated or pretty hard to find enough information that tells you how to start your project because there may be a lot of things to consider.</p> <p>I think an important insight to get anything out of model-driven something is to understand that the model is not necessarily a set of nice pictures or tree model or UML, but may as well be a textual description (e.g. a state machine, business rules etc.).</p> <p>What do you think and what does your experience tell you? Is there a future for model-driven development (or whatever you may want to call it)?</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> There does not seem to be a lot of interest in this topic. Please let me know, if you have any (good or bad) experience with model-driven approaches or why you think it's not interesting at all.</p>

21388	0	Represent Ordering in a Relational Database <p>I have a collection of objects in a database. Images in a photo gallery, products in a catalog, chapters in a book, etc. Each object is represented as a row. I want to be able to arbitrarily order these images, storing that ordering in the database so when I display the objects, they will be in the right order.</p> <p>For example, let's say I'm writing a book, and each chapter is an object. I write my book, and put the chapters in the following order:</p> <blockquote> <p>Introduction, Accessibility, Form vs. Function, Errors, Consistency, Conclusion, Index</p> </blockquote> <p>It goes to the editor, and comes back with the following suggested order:</p> <blockquote> <p>Introduction, Form, Function, Accessibility, Consistency, Errors, Conclusion, Index</p> </blockquote> <p>How can I store this ordering in the database in a robust, efficient way?</p> <p>I've had the following ideas, but I'm not thrilled with any of them:</p> <ol> <li><p>Array. Each row has an ordering ID, when order is changed (via a removal followed by an insertion), the order IDs are updated. This makes retrieval easy, since it's just <code>ORDER BY</code>, but it seems easy to break.</p> <blockquote> <p><code>// REMOVAL</code><br> <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=NULL WHERE orderingID=removedID</code><br> <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID-1 WHERE orderingID &gt; removedID</code><br> <code>// INSERTION</code><br> <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID+1 WHERE orderingID &gt; insertionID</code><br> <code>UPDATE ... SET orderID=insertionID WHERE ID=addedID</code></p> </blockquote></li> <li><p>Linked list. Each row has a column for the id of the next row in the ordering. Traversal seems costly here, though there may by some way to use <code>ORDER BY</code> that I'm not thinking of.</p></li> <li><p>Spaced array. Set the orderingID (as used in #1) to be large, so the first object is 100, the second is 200, etc. Then when an insertion happens, you just place it at <code>(objectBefore + objectAfter)/2</code>. Of course, this would need to be rebalanced occasionally, so you don't have things too close together (even with floats, you'd eventually run into rounding errors).</p></li> </ol> <p>None of these seem particularly elegant to me. Does anyone have a better way to do it?</p>

I'm using <a href="http://www.stardeveloper.com/articles/display.html?article=2007110401&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this implementation</a> (and tried a few others that hook into Application_BeginRequest), and it seems to be corrupting the external CSS file that the pages use, but intermittently...suddenly all styles will disappear on a page refresh, stay that way for awhile, and then suddenly start working again.</p> <p>Both IE7 and FF3 exhibit this behavior. When viewing the CSS using the web developer toolbar, it returns jibberish. The cache-control header is coming through as "private," but I don't know enough to figure out if that's a contributing factor or not.</p> <p>Also, this is running on the ASP.NET Development Server. Maybe it'd be fine with IIS, but I'm developing on XP and it'd be IIS5.</p>

When we create a window, our normal practice is to put <code>this</code> in the window's user data area via <code>SetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_USERDATA, this)</code>, which allows us to have an MFC-like callback or a tightly integrated <code>WndProc</code>, depending. The problem is that this will not work on 64-bit Windows, since LONG is only 32-bits wide. What's a better solution to this problem that works on both 32- and 64-bit systems?</p>
23091	0	How to write a spec that is productive? <p>I've seen different program managers write specs in different format. Almost every one has had his/her own style of writing a spec.</p> <p>On one hand are those wordy documents which given to a programmer are likely to cause him/her missing a few things. I personally dread the word documents spec...I think its because of my reading style...I am always speed reading things which I think will cause me to miss out on key points.</p> <p>On the other hand, I have seen this innovative specs written in Excel by one of our clients. The way he used to write the spec was kind of create a mock application in Excel and use some VBA to mock it. He would do things like on button click where should the form go or what action should it perform (in comments). </p> <p>On data form, he would display a form in cells and on each data entry cell he would comment on what valid values are, what validation should it perform etc. </p> <p>I think that using this technique, it was less likely to miss out on things that needed to be done. Also, it was much easier to unit test it for the developer. The tester too had a better understanding of the system as it 'performed' before actually being written.</p> <p>Visio is another tool to do screen design but I still think Excel has a better edge over it considering its VBA support and its functions.</p> <p>Do you think this should become a more popular way of writing spec? I know it involves a bit of extra work on part of project manager(or whoever is writing the spec) but the payoff is huge...I myself could see a lot of productivity gain from using it. And if there are any better formats of specs that would actually help programmer.</p>

I'm trying to improve the second line (index &lt;- read.table...) so that it would not depend on the outside source.</p> <pre><code>macroIndex &lt;- function(obj, index) { index &lt;- read.table("conv.csv", header=T, dec=",") a &lt;- c() b &lt;- names(obj) for (i in 2:length(obj)) { obj[i] &lt;- obj[i] * index[which(index==b[i]), 2] } obj } </code></pre> <p>Another solution I tried, while it may not seem pretty, it gets the job done. I use dput(index) and create a permanent object which I then insert into my function.</p>

As far as I know, an array allows me to represent any multidimensional data, so currently I am using:</p> <pre><code>&gt; points&lt;-array( c(1,2,0,1,3,0,2,4,0,2,5,0,2,7,0,3,8,0), dim=c(3,6) ) &gt; points [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [1,] 1 1 2 2 2 3 -- x dim [2,] 2 3 4 5 7 8 -- y dim [3,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 -- z dim </code></pre> <p>The aim is to perform some computations to calculate the euclidean distance between two sets of points such as:</p> <pre><code>points1&lt;-array( c(1,2,0,1,3,0,2,4,0,2,5,0,2,7,0,3,8,0), dim=c(3,6) ) points2&lt;-array( c(2,2,0,1,4,0,2,3,0,2,4,0,2,6,0,2,8,0), dim=c(3,6) ) </code></pre> <p>(any hint in this sense would also be highly appreciated)</p>
2765374	1	Efficient calculation of matrix cumulative standard deviation in r <p>I recently posted this question on the r-help mailing list but got no answers, so I thought I would post it here as well and see if there were any suggestions.</p> <p>I am trying to calculate the cumulative standard deviation of a matrix. I want a function that accepts a matrix and returns a matrix of the same size where output cell (i,j) is set to the standard deviation of input column j between rows 1 and i. NAs should be ignored, unless cell (i,j) of the input matrix itself is NA, in which case cell (i,j) of the output matrix should also be NA.</p> <p>I could not find a built-in function, so I implemented the following code. Unfortunately, this uses a loop that ends up being somewhat slow for large matrices. Is there a faster built-in function or can someone suggest a better approach?</p> <pre><code>cumsd &lt;- function(mat) { retval &lt;- mat*NA for (i in 2:nrow(mat)) retval[i,] &lt;- sd(mat[1:i,], na.rm=T) retval[is.na(mat)] &lt;- NA retval } </code></pre> <p>Thanks.</p>

2767219	1	R: How to replace elements of a data.frame? <p>I'm trying to replace elements of a data.frame containing "#N/A" with "NULL", and I'm running into problems: </p> <pre><code>foo &lt;- data.frame("day"= c(1, 3, 5, 7), "od" = c(0.1, "#N/A", 0.4, 0.8)) indices_of_NAs &lt;- which(foo == "#N/A") replace(foo, indices_of_NAs, "NULL") </code></pre> <p>Error in <code>[&lt;-.data.frame</code>(<code>*tmp*</code>, list, value = "NULL") : new columns would leave holes after existing columns</p> <p>I think that the problem is that my index is treating the data.frame as a vector, but that the replace function is treating it differently somehow, but I'm not sure what the issue is?</p>
2769510	1	Numeric comparison difficulty in R <p>I'm trying to compare two numbers in R as a part of a if-statement condition:</p> <p><code>(a-b) &gt;= 0.5</code></p> <p>In this particular instance, a = 0.58 and b = 0.08... and yet <code>(a-b) &gt;= 0.5</code> is false. I'm aware of the dangers of using <code>==</code> for exact number comparisons, and this seems related:</p> <p><code>(a - b) == 0.5)</code> is false, while </p> <p><code>all.equal((a - b), 0.5)</code> is true.</p> <p>The only solution I can think of is to have two conditions: <code>(a-b) &gt; 0.5 | all.equal((a-b), 0.5)</code>. This works, but is that really the only solution? Should I just swear off of the <code>=</code> family of comparison operators forever?</p> <p><strong>Edit for clarity:</strong> I know that this is a floating point problem. More fundamentally, what I'm asking is: what should I do about it? What's a sensible way to deal with greater-than-or-equal-to comparisons in R, since the <code>&gt;=</code> can't really be trusted?</p>

I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.</p> <p>I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like <code>Page.Response.BufferOutput = False</code>. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?</p> <p>For reference, a link to the working version of a simpler version of my application is located @ <a href="http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx</a> and the same version that isn't working is located @ <a href="http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx</a>. You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad.</p>

2772573	1	from ggplot2 to OOo workflow? <p>This is not really a programming question, but I try here none the less.</p> <p>I once used latex for my reports. But the people I work with needs to make small edits and do not have latex skillz. Openoffice is then the way to go. But saving ggplot images with dpi >100 makes for really ugly graphs. dpi = 600 is a no go (e.g. huge legend). So what to do?</p> <p>I currently save (still via ggsave) to eps - which openoffice can import. But performance is not good at all.</p> <p>Googling I found a bug for the poor eps performance in OOo, and also talk about a non-implemented svg feature. But none helps me right now.</p> <p>If you work with ggplot2 and OOo - What do you do? I have been unsuccesfull with pdf conversion for some reason. </p>
2775231	1	R + Bioconductor : combining probesets in an ExpressionSet <p>First off, this may be the wrong Forum for this question, as it's pretty darn R+Bioconductor specific. Here's what I have:</p> <pre><code>library('GEOquery') GDS = getGEO('GDS785') cd4T = GDS2eSet(GDS) cd4T &lt;- cd4T[!fData(cd4T)$symbol == "",] </code></pre> <p>Now cd4T is an ExpressionSet object which wraps a big matrix with 19794 rows (probesets) and 15 columns (samples). The final line gets rid of all probesets that do not have corresponding gene symbols. Now the trouble is that most genes in this set are assigned to more than one probeset. You can see this by doing</p> <pre><code>gene_symbols = factor(fData(cd4T)$Gene.symbol) length(gene_symbols)-length(levels(gene_symbols)) [1] 6897 </code></pre> <p>So only 6897 of my 19794 probesets have unique probeset -> gene mappings. I'd like to somehow combine the expression levels of each probeset associated with each gene. I don't care much about the actual probe id for each probe. I'd like very much to end up with an ExpressionSet containing the merged information as all of my downstream analysis is designed to work with this class. </p> <p>I think I can write some code that will do this by hand, and make a new expression set from scratch. However, I'm assuming this can't be a new problem and that code exists to do it, using a statistically sound method to combine the gene expression levels. I'm guessing there's a proper name for this also but my googles aren't showing up much of use. Can anyone help?</p>

However, I guess I kind of know the general concensus is to <em>just do it</em> , However, I seem to have the following problems getting my head into the game:</p> <ul> <li>When working with collections, do will still test for obvious add/remove/inserts successful, even when based on Generics etc where we kind of "know" its going to work?</li> <li>Some tests seem to take forever to implement.. Such as when working with string output, is there a "better" way to go about this sort of thing? (e.g. test the object model before parsing, break parsing down into small ops and test there) In my mind you should always test the "end result" but that can vary wildly and be tedious to set up.</li> <li>I don't have a testing framework to use (work wont pay for one) so I can "practice" more. Are there any good ones that are free for commercial use? (at the moment I am using good 'ol <em>Debug.Assert</em> :)</li> <li>Probably the biggest.. Sometimes I don't know what to expect <em>NOT</em> to happen.. I mean, you get your green light but I am always concerned that I may be missing a test.. Do you dig deeper to try and break the code, or leave it be and wait for it all fall over later (which will cost more)..</li> </ul> <p>So basically what I am looking for here is not a " <em>just do it</em> " but more " <em>I did this, had problems with this, solved them by this</em> "..

25007	0	Conditional formatting -- percentage to color conversion <p>What's the easiest way to convert a percentage to a color ranging from Green (100%) to Red (0%), with Yellow for 50%?</p> <p>I'm using plain 32bit RGB - so each component is an integer between 0 and 255. I'm doing this in C#, but I guess for a problem like this the language doesn't really matter that much.</p> <p>Based on Marius and Andy's answers I'm using the following solution:</p> <pre><code>double red = (percent &lt; 50) ? 255 : 256 - (percent - 50) * 5.12; double green = (percent &gt; 50) ? 255 : percent * 5.12; var color = Color.FromArgb(255, (byte)red, (byte)green, 0); </code></pre> <p>Works perfectly - Only adjustment I had to make from Marius solution was to use 256, as (255 - (percent - 50) * 5.12 yield -1 when 100%, resulting in Yellow for some reason in Silverlight (-1, 255, 0) -> Yellow ...</p>
2784896	1	Getting caught in loops - R <p>I am looking at whether or not certain 'systems' for betting really do work as claimed, namely, that they have a positive expectation. One such system is based on the rebate on loss. You basically have a large master pot, say $1 million. Your bankroll for each game is $50k.</p> <p>The way it works, is as follows: 1) Start with $50k, always bet on banker 2) If you win, add the money to the master pot. Then play again with $50k. 3) If you lose(now you're at $30k) play till you either: (a) hit 0, you get a rebate of 10%. Begin playing again with $50k+5k=$55k. (b) If you win more than the initial bankroll, add the money to the master pot. Then play again with $50k. 4) Continue until you double the master pot.</p> <p>I just cant find an easy way of programming out the possible cases in R, since you can eventually go down an improbable path.</p> <p>For example, you start at 50k, lose 20, win 19, now you're at 49, now you lose 20, lose 20, now youre at 9, you either lose 9 and get back 5k or you win and this cycle continues until you either end up with more than 50k or hit 0 and get the rebate on the 50k and start again with $50k +5k.</p> <p>Here's some code i started, but i havent figured out a good way of handling the cases where you get stuck and keeping track of the number of games played. Thanks again for your help.

For example, &quot;htmlentities&quot; seems to be a much used function in the PHP world and I found it to be absolutely annoying when you've put an effort into keeping every string localizable, only store UTF-8 in your database, only deliver UTF-8 webpages etc. Suddenly, somewhere between your database and the browser there's this hopelessly naive function pretending every byte is a character and messes everything up.</p> <p>I would just <i>love</i> to just dump this kind of functions, they seem totally superfluous. <b>Is it still necessary these days to write '&amp;auml;' instead of 'ä'?</b> At least my Firefox seems perfectly happy to display even the strangest Asian glyphs as long as they're served in a proper encoding.</p> <p><b>Update:</b> To be more precise: Are named entities necessary for <i>anything else than displaying HTML tags</i> (as in &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; for &quot;&lt;&quot;)</p> <h3>Update 2:</h3> <p>@Konrad: Are you saying that, no, named entities are not needed?</p> <p>@Ross: But wouldn't it be better to sanitize user input when it's entered, to keep my output logic free from such issues?

25455	0	What is the most efficient way to populate a time (or time range)? <p>While plenty of solutions exist for entering dates (such as calendars, drop-down menus, etc.), it doesn't seem like there are too many "standard" ways to ask for a time (or time range).</p> <p>I've personally tried drop-down menus for the hour, minute, and second fields (and sometimes an "AM/PM" field, as well). I've also tried several clock-like input devices, most of which are too hard to use for the typical end-user. I've even tried "pop-out" time selection menus (which allow you to, for example, hover over the hour "10" to receive a sub-menu that contains ":00",":15",":30", and ":45") -- but none of these methods seem natural.</p> <p>So far, the best (and most universal) method I have found is just using simple text fields and forcing a user to manually populate the hour, minute, and second. Alternatively, I've had good experiences creating something similar to Outlook's "Day View" which allows you to drag and drop an event to set the start and end times.</p> <p>Is there a "best way" to ask for this information? Is anybody using some type of time input widget that's really intuitive and easy to use? Or is there at least a way that's more efficient than using plain text boxes? ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­</p>

However, I'm afraid people would see such a feature as an invitation to hacking, which would discourage regular players due to impossibly high scores.</p> <p>I thought about the obvious ways of preventing such attempts (public/private key encryption, for example), but I've figured out reasonably simple ways hackers could circumvent all of my ideas (extracting the public key from the binary and thus sending fake encrypted scores, for example).</p> <p>Have you ever implemented an online highscore list or leaderboard?

26383	0	Exception handling: Contract vs Exceptional approach <p>I know two approaches to Exception handling, lets have a look at them.</p> <ol> <li><p>Contract approach.</p> <p>When a method does not do what it says it will do in the method header, it will throw an exception. Thus the method &quot;promises&quot; that it will do the operation, and if it fails for some reason, it will throw an exception.</p> </li> <li><p>Exceptional approach.</p> <p>Only throw exceptions when something truly weird happens. You should not use exceptions when you can resolve the situation with normal control flow (If statements). You don't use Exceptions for control flow, as you might in the contract approach.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Lets use both approaches in different cases:</p> <p>We have a Customer class that has a method called OrderProduct.</p> <p>contract approach:</p> <pre><code>class Customer { public void OrderProduct(Product product) { if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0) throw new NoCreditException(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;); // do stuff } } </code></pre> <p>exceptional approach:</p> <pre><code>class Customer { public bool OrderProduct(Product product) { if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0) return false; // do stuff return true; } } if !(customer.OrderProduct(product)) Console.WriteLine(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;); else // go on with your life </code></pre> <p>Here I prefer the exceptional approach, as it is not truly Exceptional that a customer has no money assuming he did not win the lottery.</p> <p>But here is a situation I err on the contract style.</p> <p>Exceptional:</p> <pre><code>class CarController { // returns null if car creation failed. public Car CreateCar(string model) { // something went wrong, wrong model return null; } } </code></pre> <p>When I call a method called CreateCar, I damn wel expect a Car instance instead of some lousy null pointer, which can ravage my running code a dozen lines later. Thus I prefer contract to this one:</p> <pre><code>class CarController { public Car CreateCar(string model) { // something went wrong, wrong model throw new CarModelNotKnownException(&quot;Model unkown&quot;); return new Car(); } } </code></pre> <p>Which do style do you use? What do you think is best general approach to Exceptions?</p>

28280	0	Can I maintain state between calls to a SQL Server UDF? <p>I have a SQL script that inserts data (via INSERT statements currently numbering in the thousands) One of the columns contains a unique identifier (though not an IDENTITY type, just a plain ol' int) that's actually unique across a few different tables. </p> <p>I'd like to add a scalar function to my script that gets the next available ID (i.e. last used ID + 1) but I'm not sure this is possible because there doesn't seem to be a way to use a global or static variable from within a UDF, I can't use a temp table, and I can't update a permanent table from within a function. </p> <p>Currently my script looks like this: </p> <pre> declare @v_baseID int exec dbo.getNextID @v_baseID out --sproc to get the next available id --Lots of these - where n is a hardcoded value insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', @v_baseID + n ) exec dbo.UpdateNextID @v_baseID + lastUsedn --sproc to update the last used id </pre> <p>But I would like it to look like this: </p> <pre> --Lots of these insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', getNextID() ) </pre> <p>Hardcoding the offset is a pain in the arse, and is error prone. Packaging it up into a simple scalar function is very appealing, but I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls. Is that right, or is there something I'm missing. </p> <p>We're using SQL Server 2005 at the moment. </p> <p><em>edits for clarification:</em></p> <p>Two users hitting it won't happen.

28668	0	Best way to extract data from a FileMaker Pro database in a script? <p>My job would be easier, or at least less tedious if I could come up with an automated way (preferably in a Python script) to extract useful information from a FileMaker Pro database. I am working on Linux machine and the FileMaker database is on the same LAN running on an OS X machine. I can log into the webby interface from my machine.</p> <p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p> <p>It's not my first choice, but I'd use Perl instead of Python if there was a Perl-y solution at hand.</p> <p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p> <p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>
3002638	1	Eta/Eta-squared routines in R <p>Apart from graphical estimation of linearity (gaze-at-scatterplot method), which is utilized before applying some technique from GLM family, there are several ways to do this estimation arithmetically (i.e. without graphs).</p> <p>Right now, I'll focus on Fisher's <em>eta-squared</em> - correlation ratio: arithmetically, it's equal to squared Pearson's <em>r</em> (coef. of determination: <em>r<sup>2</sup></em>) if relationship between two variables is linear. Hence, you can compare values of <em>eta</em> and <em>r</em> and make an assessment about type of relation (linear or not). It provides an information about percent of variance in the dependent variable explained (linearly or not) by the independent variable. Therefore, you can apply it when linearity assumptions are not met. </p> <p>Simply stated: is there a routine for eta/eta-squared in R?</p>

The summary information never contains a tab, so the following function works:</p> <pre><code>read.parameters &lt;- function(file.name, ...){ lines &lt;- scan(file.name, what="character", sep="\n") first.line &lt;- min(grep("\\t", lines)) return(read.delim(file.name, skip=first.line-1, ...)) } </code></pre> <p>However, these logfiles are quite big, and so reading the file twice is very slow. Surely there is a better way?</p> <p><b>Edited to add:</b></p> <p>Marek suggested using a <code>textConnection</code> object.

29643	0	Which is a better approach in logging - files or DB? <p>Okay, here's the scenario. I have a utility that processes tons of records, and enters information to the Database accordingly.</p> <p>It works on these records in multi-threaded batches. Each such batch writes to the same log file for creating a workflow trace for each record. Potentially, we could be making close to a million log writes in a day.</p> <p>Should this log be made into a database residing on another server? Considerations:</p> <ol> <li>The obvious disadvantage of multiple threads writing to the same log file is that the log messages are shuffled amongst each other. In the database, they can be grouped by batch id.</li> <li>Performance - which would slow down the batch processing more? writing to a local file or sending log data to a database on another server on the same network. Theoretically, the log file is faster, but is there a gotcha here?</li> </ol> <p>Are there any optimizations that can be done on either approach?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

29694	0	How to work around unsupported unsigned integer field types in MS SQL? <p>Trying to make a MySQL-based application support MS SQL, I ran into the following issue:</p> <p>I keep MySQL's auto_increment as unsigned integer fields (of various sizes) in order to make use of the full range, as I know there will never be negative values. MS SQL does not support the unsigned attribute on all integer types, so I have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround.</p> <p>One very naive approach would be to put some code in the database abstraction code or in a stored procedure that converts between negative values on the db side and values from the larger portion of the unsigned range. This would mess up sorting of course, and also it would not work with the auto-id feature (or would it some way?).</p> <p>I can't think of a <em>good</em> workaround right now, is there any? Or am I just being fanatic and should simply forget about half the range?</p> <p><i>Edit:<br> @Mike Woodhouse: Yeah, I guess you're right. There's still a voice in my head saying that maybe I could reduce the field's size if I optimize its utilization. But if there's no easy way to do this, it's probably not worth worrying about it.</i></p>

The solution isn't ideal as the number "5" is rather magical.</p> <pre><code>while( length(o) %% 5 != 0 ) { o &lt;- o[-length(o)] } omean &lt;- apply( matrix(o, 5), 2, mean ) </code></pre> <p>What other options are available?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Subversion) applicable in document tracking? <p>I am in charge of about 100+ documents (word document, not source code) that needs revision by different people in my department. Currently all the documents are in a shared folder where they will retrieve, revise and save back into the folder. </p> <p>What I am doing now is looking up the "date modified" in the shared folder, opened up recent modified documents and use the "Track Change" function in MS Word to apply the changes.

29882	0	What would be a good, windows and iis (http) based distributed version control system <p>At my job we make &amp; sell websites. Usually we install our .NET C# based site on a customer's server and maintain and support it remotely. However, every once in a while, for bigger development works and just to make things simpler (and faster!), we will copy the site to a local server.</p> <p>This is great, but has one pain - moving the site back to the customer. Now, If nothing was change on the customer's copy - no problem. However, it is the sad truth that sometime (read more often than I would like) some fixes were needed to be applied on the production server. Either because the customer needed it NOW or simply because it was major bug.</p> <p>I know that you can easily apply those bug fixes to the local copy as well, but this is an error prone process. So I'm setting my hopes on a distributed version control to help synchronize the two copies.</p> <p>Here is what I need:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to install - nothing else needed except the installer and admin rights.</li> <li>Can integrated in an existing website as a virtual directory and works on port 80 - no hassle with new DNS required.</li> <li>Excellent software</li> </ul> <p>That's it. Any ideas?</p> <hr> <h2>Some comments on the answers</h2> <p>First, thanks! much appreciated.</p> <p>I've looked at Mercurial and Bazaar and both look very good. The only caveat is the installation as a virtual directory on IIS. Mercurial, as far as I understand, use a special protocol (wire) and Bazaar needs and addition of python extensions. Is there another system which is easier to integrate with IIS? I'm willing to take a performance hit for that.</p>

Is there such a tool for C#?

My goal is to have certain features that are available based on the current user's group membership.</p> <p>I know that the CustomAction tag that controls the creation of this menu item has a Rights attribute. The problem that I have with this is that the groups I am using have identical rights in the site (ViewListItems, ManageAlerts, etc). The groups that we have set up deal more with function, such as Manager, Employee, etc. We want to be able to assign a custom feature to a group, and have the menu items associated with that feature visible only to members of that group. Everyone has the same basic site permissions, but will have extra options availble based on their login credentials.</p> <p>I have seen several articles on modifying the Core.js file to hide items in the context menu, but they are an all-or-nothing approach.

3137525	1	XTS size limitation <p>I have been working on large datasets lately (more than 400 thousands lines). So far, I have been using XTS format, which worked fine for "small" datasets of a few tenth of thousands elements.</p> <p>Now that the project grows, R simply crashes when retrieving the data for the database and putting it into the XTS.</p> <p>It is my understanding that R should be able to have vectors with size up to 2^32-1 elements (or 2^64-1 according the the version). Hence, I came to the conclusion that XTS might have some limitations but I could not find the answer in the doc. (maybe I was a bit overconfident about my understanding of theoretical possible vector size).</p> <p>To sum up, I would like to know if:</p> <ol> <li>XTS has indeed a size limitation</li> <li>What do you think is the smartest way to handle large time series? (I was thinking about splitting the analysis into several smaller datasets).</li> <li>I don't get an error message, R simply shuts down automatically.

31567	0	How to properly cast objects created through reflection <p>I'm trying to wrap my head around reflection, so I decided to add plugin capability to a program that I'm writing. The only way to understand a concept is to get your fingers dirty and write the code, so I went the route of creating a simple interface library consisting of the IPlugin and IHost interfaces, a plugin implementation library of classes that implement IPlugin, and a simple console project that instantiates the IHost implementation class that does simple work with the plugin objects. </p> <p>Using reflection, I wanted to iterate through the types contained inside my plugin implementation dll and create instances of types. I was able to sucessfully instantiate classes with this code, but I could not cast the created object to the interface.</p> <p>I tried this code but I couldn't cast object o as I expected. I stepped through the process with the debugger and the proper constructor was called. Quickwatching object o showed me that it had the fields and properties that I expected to see in the implementation class. </p> <pre><code>loop through assemblies loop through types in assembly // Filter out unwanted types if (!type.IsClass || type.IsNotPublic || type.IsAbstract ) continue; // This successfully created the right object object o = Activator.CreateInstance(type); // This threw an Invalid Cast Exception or returned null for an "as" cast // even though the object implemented IPlugin IPlugin i = (IPlugin) o; </code></pre> <p>I made the code work with this.</p> <pre><code>using System.Runtime.Remoting; ObjectHandle oh = Activator.CreateInstance(assembly.FullName, type.FullName); // This worked as I intended IPlugin i = (IPlugin) oh.Unwrap(); i.DoStuff(); </code></pre> <p>Here are my questions:</p> <ol> <li>Activator.CreateInstance(Type t) returns an object, but I couldn't cast the object to an interface that the object implemented.

You cannot decorate these methods with the <strong>XmlIgnore</strong> attribute either, so we cannot stop it that way.</p> <p>My current solution is to remove the interface implementation (in this current application, its no real big deal, just made the code prettier).</p> <p><strong>Do I need to swallow my pride on this one and accept it cant be done?</strong> I know I have kinda pushed and got more out of the XmlSerializer than what was expected of it :)</p> <hr /> <h3>Edit</h3> <p>I should also add, I am currently working in framework 2.</p> <hr /> <h3>Update</h3> <p>I have accepted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31799/preventing-xml-serialization-of-ienumerable-and-icollectiont-inherited-types#31810">lomaxx's answer</a>.

32246	0	how to get the googlebot to get the correct GEOIPed content? <p>OK. This problem is doing my head in. And I don't know if there even IS a definitive answer.</p> <p>We have a website, lets call it <em>mycompany.com</em>. It's a UK-based site, with UK based content. Google knows about it, and we have done a load of SEO on it. All is well.</p> <p><strong>Except</strong>, we are about to relaunch <strong>my company, the GLOBAL brand</strong>, so we now need mycompany.com/uk, mycompany.com/us, and mycompany.com/au, for the various countries local content. We are using GEOIP, so if someone from the US loads mycompany.com, they get redirected to mycompany.com/us etc. </p> <p>If someone isn't in one of those three countries (US, Australia, or UK) they get the UK site.</p> <p>This is all well and good, but we dont want to lose the rather large amount of Google juice we have on mycompany.com! And worse, the Google bot appears to be 100% based in the US, so the US site (which is pretty much out LEAST important one of the three) will appear to be the main one.</p> <p><strong>We have thought about detecting the bot</strong>, and serving UK content, but it appears Google may smack us for that.</p> <p>Has anyone else come across this situation, and have a solution?</p>

32369	0	Disable browser 'Save Password' functionality <p>One of the joys of working for a government healthcare agency is having to deal with all of the paranoia around dealing with PHI (Protected Health Information). Don't get me wrong, I'm all for doing everything possible to protect people's personal information (health, financial, surfing habits, etc.), but sometimes people get a little too jumpy.</p> <p>Case in point: One of our state customers recently found out that the browser provides the handy feature to save your password. We all know that it has been there for a while and is completely optional and is up to the end user to decide whether or not it is a smart decision to use or not. However, there is a bit of an uproar at the moment and we are being demanded to find a way to disable that functionality for our site.</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a way for a site to tell the browser not to offer to remember passwords? I've been around web development a long time but don't know that I have come across that before.</p> <p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
32377	0	Test plans and how best to write them <p>We're trying to figure out the best way to write tests in our test plan. Specifically, when writing a test that is meant to be used by anyone including QA staff, should the steps in the test be very specific or more broad giving the tester more leeway in how the task can be accomplished. As a very simple example, if you're testing opening a document in word processing document, should the test read:</p> <ol> <li>Using the mouse, open the file menu</li> <li>Choose "Open File..." in the file menu</li> <li>In the open file dialog that appears, navigate to x and double-click the document called y</li> </ol> <p>OR </p> <ol> <li>Bring up the file open dialog</li> <li>Open the file y</li> </ol> <p>Now I realize one answer is probably going to be "it depends on what you're trying to test" but I'm trying to answer a broader question here: If the test steps are too specific do we risk a) making the testing process to laborious and tedious and more importantly b) do we risk missing something because we wrote down too specific a path to achieve a goal. Alternatively, if we make it broad do we depend too much on the whims of the tester at the time and lose crucial testing of paths that are more common to customers/clients?</p>

3205302	1	Difference between Rscript and littler <p>...besides the fact that <strong><em>Rscript</em></strong> is invoked with <code>#!/usr/bin/env Rscript</code> and <strong><em>littler</em></strong> with <code>#!/usr/local/bin/r</code> (on my system) in first line of script file. I've found certain differences in execution speed (seems like <em>littler</em> is a bit slower). </p> <p>I've created two dummy scripts, ran each 1000 times and compared average execution time.</p> <p>Here's the Rscript file:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env Rscript btime &lt;- proc.time() x &lt;- rnorm(100) print(x) print(plot(x)) etime &lt;- proc.time() tm &lt;- etime - btime sink(file = "rscript.r.out", append = TRUE) cat(paste(tm[1:3], collapse = ";"), "\n") sink() print(tm) </code></pre> <p>and here's the littler file:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/r btime &lt;- proc.time() x &lt;- rnorm(100) print(x) print(plot(x)) etime &lt;- proc.time() tm &lt;- etime - btime sink(file = "little.r.out", append = TRUE) cat(paste(tm[1:3], collapse = ";"), "\n") sink() print(tm) </code></pre> <p>As you can see, they are almost identical (first line and sink file argument differ). Output is <code>sink</code>ed to text file, hence imported in R with <code>read.table</code>. I've created bash script to execute each script 1000 times, then calculated averages.</p> <p>Here's bash script:</p> <pre><code>for i in `seq 1000` do ./$1 echo "####################" echo "Iteration #$i" echo "####################" done </code></pre> <p>And the results are: </p> <pre><code># littler script &gt; mean(lit) user system elapsed 0.489327 0.035458 0.588647 &gt; sapply(lit, median) L1 L2 L3 0.490 0.036 0.609 # Rscript &gt; mean(rsc) user system elapsed 0.219334 0.008042 0.274017 &gt; sapply(rsc, median) R1 R2 R3 0.220 0.007 0.258 </code></pre> <p>Long story short: beside (obvious) execution-time difference, is there some other difference?

33475	0	ssh hangs when command invoked directly, but exits cleanly when run interactive <p>I need to launch a server on the remote machine and retrieve the port number that the server process is lsitening on. When invoked, the server will listen on a random port and output the port number on stderr.</p> <p>I want to automate the process of logging on to the remote machine, launching the process, and retrieving the port number. I wrote a Python script called "<code>invokejob.py</code>" that lives on the remote machine to act as a wrapper that invokes the job and then returns the port number, it looks like this:</p> <pre><code>import re, subprocess executable = ... # Name of executable regex = ... # Regex to extract the port number from the output p = subprocess.Popen(executable, bufsize=1, # line buffered stderr=subprocess.PIPE ) s = p.stderr.readline() port = re.match(regex).groups()[0] print port </code></pre> <p>If I log in interactively, this script works:</p> <pre><code>$ ssh remotehost.example.com Last login: Thu Aug 28 17:31:18 2008 from localhost $ ./invokejob.py 63409 $ exit logout Connection to remotehost.example.com closed. </code></pre> <p>(Note: successful logout, it did not hang).</p> <p>However, if I try to invoke it from the command-line, it just hangs:</p> <pre><code>$ ssh remotehost.example.com invokejob.py </code></pre> <p>Does anybody know why it hangs in the second case, and what I can do to avoid this? </p> <p>Note that I need to retrieve the output of the program, so I can't just use the ssh "-f" flag or redirect standard output.</p>
33510	0	What is the best approach to both modularity and platform independence? <p>I hope this question does not come off as broad as it may seem at first. I am designing a software application in my <code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code><em>voluminous</em><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> spare time. I would like it to be both cross-platform and modular. At this point, because I am still in the planning phase, I can pick practically any language and toolset.</p> <p>This makes things harder, not easier, because there are seemingly so many ways of accomplishing both of the goals (modularity, platform agnosticism). </p> <p>My basic premise is that security, data storage, interaction with the operating system, and configuration should all be handled by a "container" application - but most of the other functionality will be supplied through plug-in modules. If I had to describe it at a high level (without completely giving away my idea), it would be a single application that can do many different jobs, all dedicated to the same goal (there are lots of disparate things to do, but all the data has to interact and be highly available).</p> <p>This is not a new idea, and not particularly exotic. Yet I find myself wrestling with not so much how to do it (I can think of lots of ways), but which method is best.</p> <p>For example, I know that Eclipse practically embodies what I am describing, but I find Java applications in general (and Eclipse is no exception) to be too large and slow for what I need. Ditto desktop apps written Python and Ruby (which are excellent languages!) </p> <p>I don't mind recompiling the code base for different platforms as native exectables. Yet, C and C++ have their own set of issues.</p> <p>As a C# developer, I have a preference for managed code. But I am not at all sold on Mono, yet (I could be convinced).</p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas/experiences/ specific favorite frameworks to share?</p>

I see several benefits here - first, I don't have to worry about losing my code if my computer crashes and burns or my external HDD crashes and burns; second, I can share my code with the world and perhaps even get more help when I need it.</p> <p>Is this a good idea?

What's got me the closest so far is:</p> <pre><code>testmat &lt;- matrix(rnorm(10000),nrow=1000,ncol=100) column.ind &lt;- sample(3:100,20) teststr &lt;- paste("testmat[,",column.ind,"]",sep="",collapse=",") </code></pre> <p>which gives me a string that has a <code>testmat[,column.ind]</code> for every sampled index number.

3305613	1	using grid and ggplot2 to create join plots using R <p>I would like to know what can I do to fix a grid of plots. The plots are arranged in an array so that all the plots in a row have the same Y axis variable and all the plots in a column have the same X axis variable.</p> <p>When joined together in a grid this creates a multiplot. I disable the labels on most of the plots excepting the outer ones, since the inner ones have the same variable and scale. However, since the outer plots have labels and axis values, they result in a different size from the other ones.</p> <p>I was thinking of adding 2 more columns and rows to the grid, for the variable names and the axis range values... then plotting only the variable names on the corresponding grid space and the axis values on another grid space, therefore only plotting the points in the remaining space and getting equal sizes.</p> <p>EDIT 1: Thanks to rcs for pointing me toward <code>align.plot</code></p> <p>Edited align.plot to accept null values (for when having title/text in the axis isnt desired)</p> <p>Now I'm closer to the goal but the first columun plots are still smaller width than the rest due to the labels.</p> <p>example code:</p> <pre><code>grid_test &lt;- function () { dsmall &lt;- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 100), ] #-----/align function----- align.plots &lt;- function(gl, ...){ # Obtained from http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/browse_thread/thread/1b859d6b4b441c90 # Adopted from http://ggextra.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/R/align.r # BUGBUG: Does not align horizontally when one has a title. # There seems to be a spacer used when a title is present.

Now, I don't want to argue the virtues of rsync vs any other tool...this is not my point.</p> <p>The only way I've ever found of running rsync on windows is via a version that is built to run on top of Cygwin, and as Cygwin has issues with Unicode, so does rsync.</p> <p>Is anyone familiar enough with the workings of rsync to say if there are any real technical programming hurdles to porting rsync to a native Win32 binary? </p> <p>Or is it maybe that there has just never been enough interest from windows users to care to port it over?</p> <p>Partly I ask because I'm am considering trying to take on the task of starting a port, but I want to make sure there's not something I'm missing in terms of why it may not be possible.</p>

34664	0	DesignMode with nested Controls <p>Has anyone found a useful solution to the DesignMode problem when developing controls?</p> <p>The issue is that if you nest controls then DesignMode only works for the first level. The second and lower levels DesignMode will always return FALSE.</p> <p>The standard hack has been to look at the name of the process that is running and if it is "DevEnv.EXE" then it must be studio thus DesignMode is really TRUE.</p> <p>The problem with that is looking for the ProcessName works its way around through the registry and other strange parts with the end result that the user might not have the required rights to see the process name. In addition this strange route is very slow. So we have had to pile additional hacks to use a singleton and if an error is thrown when asking for the process name then assume that DesignMode is FALSE.</p> <p>A nice clean way to determine DesignMode is in order. Acually getting Microsoft to fix it internally to the framework would be even better!</p>

34735	0	Using a rotary encoder with AVR Micro controller <p>I'm having trouble getting a rotary encoder to work properly with AVR micro controllers. The encoder is a mechanical <a href="http://no.farnell.com/1520815/passives/product.us0?sku=alps-ec12d1524401" rel="noreferrer">ALPS encoder</a>, and I'm using <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2545.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Atmega168</a>.</p> <p><strong>Clarification</strong></p> <p>I have tried using an External Interrupt to listen to the pins, but it seems like it is too slow. When Pin A goes high, the interrupt procedure starts and then checks if Pin B is high. The idea is that if Pin B is high the moment Pin A went high, then it is rotating counter clock-wise. If Pin B is low, then it is rotating clock-wise. But it seems like the AVR takes too long to check Pin B, so it is always read as high. </p> <p>I've also tried to create a program that simply blocks until Pin B or Pin A changes. But it might be that there is too much noise when the encoder is rotated, because this does not work either. My last attempt was to have a timer which stores the last 8 values in a buffer and checks if it is going from low to high. This did not work either.</p> <p>I have tried scoping the encoder, and it seems to use between 2 and 4ms from the first Pin changes till the other Pin changes.</p>
3337306	1	GC and memory limit issues with R <p>I am using R on some relatively big data and am hitting some memory issues. This is on Linux.

I'm assuming this is OS-allocated memory that R's memory management system will allocate and GC as needed. However, lets say that I don't want to let R OS-allocate more than 4gb, to prevent swap thrashing. I could always ulimit, but then it would just crash instead of working within the reduced space and GCing more often. Is there a way to specify an arbitrary maximum for the gc trigger and make sure that R never os-allocates more? Or is there something else I could do to manage memory usage?</p>

34896	0	When is it best to sanitize user input? <p>User equals untrustworthy. Never trust untrustworthy user's input. I get that. However, I am wondering when the best time to sanitize input is. For example, do you blindly store user input and then sanitize it whenever it is accessed/used, or do you sanitize the input immediately and then store this "cleaned" version? Maybe there are also some other approaches I haven't though of in addition to these. I am leaning more towards the first method, because any data that came from user input must still be approached cautiously, where the "cleaned" data might still unknowingly or accidentally be dangerous. Either way, what method do people think is best, and for what reasons?</p>

35479	0	Exception in Web Service locks DLL and prevents publishing. Workaround? <p>I'm using a native DLL (FastImage.dll) in a C# ASP.NET Web Service that sometimes locks (can't delete it---says access denied); this requires stopping IIS to delete the DLL. The inability to delete this DLL in the bin folder of my published Web Service prevents me from publishing successfully (even though it thinks it published successfully!), which makes development and fixing the bug difficult (especially when it just happily runs old code since my changes may not be reflected on the server!). Note that the bug causing the Web Service to bomb and lock up the DLL is in my code, which is outside of said DLL, so I think this is a more general problem than just the FreeImage library (not to bring them any heat).</p> <ol> <li>Has anyone experienced this?</li> <li>Is there a way to make sure that when it says "Publish succeeded" from the VS IDE that it really means it, or to run sort of script to check that the files are really deleted before it attempts to Publish (like a pre-build step in VC++). (Right now I manually delete the files before publishing to make sure that I know the DLLs were replaced, instead of running old DLLs. It's still a problem, though if I can't delete the DLL.)</li> <li>How would I detect whether a file was successfully deleted from a batch file?

35991	0	Altering database tables in Django <p>I'm considering using Django for a project I'm starting (fyi, a browser-based game) and one of the features I'm liking the most is using <code>syncdb</code> to automatically create the database tables based on the Django models I define (a feature that I can't seem to find in any other framework). I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Syncdb will not alter existing tables</p> <p>syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.</p> <p>If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems that altering existing tables will have to be done &quot;by hand&quot;.</p> <p>What I would like to know is the best way to do this. Two solutions come to mind:</p> <ul> <li>As the documentation suggests, make the changes manually in the DB;</li> <li>Do a backup of the database, wipe it, create the tables again (with syncdb, since now it's creating the tables from scratch) and import the backed-up data (this might take too long if the database is big)</li> </ul> <p>Any ideas?</p>
36014	0	Why is .NET exception not caught by try/catch block? <p>I'm working on a project using the <a href="http://antlr.org" rel="noreferrer">ANTLR</a> parser library for C#. I've built a grammar to parse some text and it works well. However, when the parser comes across an illegal or unexpected token, it throws one of many exceptions. The problem is that in some cases (not all) that my try/catch block won't catch it and instead stops execution as an unhandled exception.</p> <p>The issue for me is that I can't replicate this issue anywhere else but in my full code. The call stack shows that the exception definitely occurs within my try/catch(Exception) block. The only thing I can think of is that there are a few ANTLR assembly calls that occur between my code and the code throwing the exception and this library does not have debugging enabled, so I can't step through it. I wonder if non-debuggable assemblies inhibit exception bubbling? The call stack looks like this; external assembly calls are in Antlr.Runtime:</p> <pre> Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefLexer.mTokens() Line 1213 C# Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.Lexer.NextToken() + 0xfc bytes Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.FillBuffer() + 0x22c bytes Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.LT(int k = 1) + 0x68 bytes Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefParser.prog() Line 109 + 0x17 bytes C# Expl.Itinerary.dll!Expl.Itinerary.TDLParser.Parse(string Text = "", Expl.Itinerary.IItinerary Itinerary = {Expl.Itinerary.MemoryItinerary}) Line 17 + 0xa bytes C# </pre> <p>The code snippet from the bottom-most call in Parse() looks like:</p> <pre><code> try { // Execution stopped at parser.prog() TimeDefParser.prog_return prog_ret = parser.prog(); return prog_ret == null ? null : prog_ret.value; } catch (Exception ex) { throw new ParserException(ex.Message, ex); } </code></pre> <p>To me, a catch (Exception) clause should've captured any exception whatsoever. Is there any reason why it wouldn't?</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I traced through the external assembly with Reflector and found no evidence of threading whatsoever. The assembly seems to just be a runtime utility class for ANTLR's generated code. The exception thrown is from the TimeDefLexer.mTokens() method and its type is NoViableAltException, which derives from RecognitionException -> Exception. This exception is thrown when the lexer cannot understand the next token in the stream; in other words, invalid input. This exception is SUPPOSED to happen, however it should've been caught by my try/catch block.</p> <p>Also, the rethrowing of ParserException is really irrelevant to this situation. That is a layer of abstraction that takes any exception during parse and convert to my own ParserException. The exception handling problem I'm experiencing is never reaching that line of code. In fact, I commented out the "throw new ParserException" portion and still received the same result.</p> <p>One more thing, I modified the original try/catch block in question to instead catch NoViableAltException, eliminating any inheritance confusion. I still received the same result.</p> <p>Someone once suggested that sometimes VS is overactive on catching handled exceptions when in debug mode, but this issue also happens in release mode.</p> <p>Man, I'm still stumped! I hadn't mentioned it before, but I'm running VS 2008 and all my code is 3.5. The external assembly is 2.0. Also, some of my code subclasses a class in the 2.0 assembly. Could a version mismatch cause this issue?</p> <p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I was able to eliminate the .NET version conflict by porting relevant portions of my .NET 3.5 code to a .NET 2.0 project and replicate the same scenario. I was able to replicate the same unhandled exception when running consistently in .NET 2.0.</p> <p>I learned that ANTLR has recently released 3.1. So, I upgraded from 3.0.1 and retried. It turns out the generated code is a little refactored, but the same unhandled exception occurs in my test cases.</p> <p><strong>Update 3:</strong> I've replicated this scenario in a <a href="http://www.explodingcoder.com/cms/files/TestAntlr-3.1.zip" rel="noreferrer">simplified VS 2008 project</a>. Feel free to download and inspect the project for yourself. I've applied all the great suggestions, but have not been able to overcome this obstacle yet.</p> <p>If you can find a workaround, please do share your findings. Thanks again!</p> <hr> <p>Thank you, but VS 2008 automatically breaks on unhandled exceptions. Also, I don't have a Debug->Exceptions dialog. The NoViableAltException that is thrown is fully intended, and designed to be caught by user code. Since it is not caught as expected, program execution halts unexpectedly as an unhandled exception.</p> <p>The exception thrown is derived from Exception and there is no multi-threading going on with ANTLR.</p>

36182	0	How expensive is ST_GeomFromText <p>In postgis, is the <code>ST_GeomFromText</code> call very expensive?

3396759	1	MySQL odbc timeout from R <p>I'm using R to read in some data from a MySQL database using the RODBC package. The data is then processed and some results are sent back to the database. The problem is that the server closes the connection after about a minute due to inactivity, which is the time needed to process the data locally. Its a shared server, so the host won't bump up the timeout time.</p> <p>I think there are two possibilities to get around this 1) Open a connection before every database transaction and close it immediately after 2) Send some small 'ping' command to the server every 30 seconds or so to let the server know that I'm still there.</p> <p>I can implement the first fairly easily, but it seems pretty slow to constantly open and close connections. Anyone know an efficient command for the second? Or a better way altogether?</p>

37391	0	Arithmetic with Arbitrarily Large Integers in PHP <p>Ok, so PHP isn't the best language to be dealing with arbitrarily large integers in, considering that it only natively supports 32-bit signed integers. What I'm trying to do though is create a class that could represent an arbitrarily large binary number and be able to perform simple arithmetic operations on two of them (add/subtract/multiply/divide).</p> <p>My target is dealing with 128-bit integers.</p> <p>There's a couple of approaches I'm looking at, and problems I see with them. Any input or commentary on what you would choose and how you might go about it would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p><strong>Approach #1:</strong> Create a 128-bit integer class that stores its integer internally as four 32-bit integers. The only problem with this approach is that I'm not sure how to go about handling overflow/underflow issues when manipulating individual chunks of the two operands.</p> <p><strong>Approach #2:</strong> Use the bcmath extension, as this looks like something it was designed to tackle. My only worry in taking this approach is the scale setting of the bcmath extension, because there can't be any rounding errors in my 128-bit integers; they must be precise. I'm also worried about being able to eventually convert the result of the bcmath functions into a binary string (which I'll later need to shove into some mcrypt encryption functions).</p> <p><strong>Approach #3:</strong> Store the numbers as binary strings (probably LSB first). Theoretically I should be able to store integers of any arbitrary size this way. All I would have to do is write the four basic arithmetic functions to perform add/sub/mult/div on two binary strings and produce a binary string result. This is exactly the format I need to hand over to mcrypt as well, so that's an added plus. This is the approach I think has the most promise at the moment, but the one sticking point I've got is that PHP doesn't offer me any way to manipulate the individual bits (that I know of). I believe I'd have to break it up into byte-sized chunks (no pun intended), at which point my questions about handling overflow/underflow from Approach #1 apply.</p>

37555	0	Adding server-side event to extender control <p>I have an extender control that raises a textbox's <code>OnTextChanged</code> event 500ms after the user has finished typing. The problem with this is that <code>OnTextChanged</code> gets raised when the textbox loses focus, which causes problems (because of the postback).</p> <p>What I'd like to do is give the extender control its own server-side event (say, <code>OnDelayedSubmit</code>) so I can handle it separately. The event will originate in the extender control's behavior script (after the 500ms delay), so putting a <code>__doPostBack</code> in <code>onchanged</code> is not an option.</p> <p>Can anyone shed light on how to go about this?</p>
3424002	1	Aggregate data from different files into data structure <p>I noticed I encounter this task quite often when programming in R, yet I don't think I implement it "pretty".</p> <p>I get a list of file names, each containing a table or a simple vector. I want to read all the files into some construct (list of tables?) so I can later manipulate them in simple loops.</p> <p>I know how to read each file into a table/vector, but I do not know how to put all these objects together in one structure (list?).</p> <p>Anyway, I guess this is VERY routine so I'll be happy to hear about your tricks.</p>
37649	0	Swapping column values in MySQL <p>I have a MySQL table with coordinates, the column names are X and Y. Now I want to swap the column values in this table, so that X becomes Y and Y becomes X. The most apparent solution would be renaming the columns, but I don't want to make structure changes since I don't necessarily have permissions to do that.</p> <p>Is this possible to do with <b>UPDATE</b> in some way? <b>UPDATE table SET X=Y, Y=X</b> obviously won't do what I want.</p> <hr> <p>Edit: Please note that my restriction on permissions, mentioned above, effectively prevents the use of ALTER TABLE or other commands that change the table/database structure. Renaming columns or adding new ones are unfortunately not options.</p>

3429013	1	Avoiding a loop when entry i might take the value of entry i-1 <p>I have vectors with mostly <code>NA</code> entries. I want to replace every <code>NA</code> with that vector's preceding non-<code>NA</code> entry. Specifically, the first entry will always be a 1, followed by a bunch of <code>NA</code>s, which I want to replace with 1. The <code>i</code>th entry could be another numeric, let's say 2, followed by more <code>NA</code>s that I want to replace with 2. And so on. The loop below achieves this, but there has to be a more R way to do it, right? I wanted to vectorize with <code>ifelse()</code>, but I couldn't figure out how to replace the <code>i</code>th entry with the <code>i-1</code>th entry.</p> <pre><code>&gt; vec &lt;- rep(NA, 10) &gt; vec [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA &gt; vec[1] &lt;- 1; vec[4] &lt;- 2; vec[7] &lt;- 3 &gt; vec [1] 1 NA NA 2 NA NA 3 NA NA NA &gt; for (i in 1:length(vec)) if (is.na(vec[i])) vec[i] &lt;- vec[i-1] &gt; vec [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 </code></pre> <p>Thanks! </p> <p>If context helps, I am adjusting for stock splits from the WRDS database, which has a column that shows when and how a split occurs.</p>

37871	0	Roaming settings with LocalFileSettingsProvider <p>On my way through whipping up a Windows Forms application I thought it might have been a good idea to use the settings file to store miscellaneous application options (instead of the registry) and user parameters (window positions, column orderings, etc.). Out of the box, quick and simple, or so I thought.</p> <p>All works as per MSDN using the default SettingsProvider (LocalFileSettingsProvider), but I do have concerns about where it gets stored and hopefully somebody can provide a solution. Essentially the file ends up in the local application data and in an unsavoury sub-directory structure. (AppData / Local / <em>company</em> / <em>namespace_StrongName_gibberish</em> / <em>version</em> ).</p> <p>Is there a way to tell the LocalFileSettingsProvider to store the configuration file so the data will roam and perhaps in a less crazy folder structure? (or maybe an implementation of SettingsProvider that already does this?)</p>

3452206	1	How do I Sweave a multiple-file project? <p>I am writing my thesis in LaTeX and because things got a bit long for my taste, I had split it into several files. Let's call them <code>thesis.tex</code>, <code>intro.tex</code>, <code>mat_n_met.tex</code>, <code>rslts.tex</code> and <code>discsn.tex</code>. I have linked <code>intro.tex</code>, <code>mat_n_met.tex</code>, <code>rslts.tex</code> and <code>discsn.tex</code> through <code>thesis.tex</code> with <code>\include{intro}</code> (and so on...). I have also created a separate file called <code>r_crunching.Rnw</code> (that I run through Sweave) that holds a chunk that runs the R script with data analysis and chunks that produce pdf outputs of graphs that I embed via <code>\includegraphics</code> (in e.g., <code>rslts.tex</code>). Still following?</p> <p>If I run a Rnw (i.e. I renamed <code>rslts.tex</code> to <code>rslts.Rnw</code>) without "a link" to the chunk with the R script, you will get a <code>Sweave()</code> error saying the reference in <code>\Sexpr{}</code> doesn't exist. Is there a way, without merging all the files into a single .Rnw, to call <code>\Sexpr{}</code> in say <code>rslts.Rnw</code>?</p> <p>Other methods how to accomplish this are welcome.</p>

3463837	1	Is it good practice to update R packages often? <p>I've started to use R a little while ago and am not sure how often to update the installed packages (at this time, I'm using mostly ggplot2 and rattle). One one hand it's the typical geek impulse to have the latest version :-) On the other, updates can break functionality and, as an R beginner, I don't want to waste time looking into package incompatibilities and reinstalling libraries, it's almost certain I wouldn't notice any difference with an improved package.</p> <p>With other applications I have a sense developed from experience on how often to upgrade, how much to wait between the release of an upgrade and installing it and so on. But I'm in the dark with regards to R.</p> <p>And to be clear: I'm not talking about R itself, but its libraries.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

39304	0	Do C++ logging frameworks sacrifice reusability? <p>In C++, there isn't a de-facto standard logging tool. In my experience, shops roll their own. This creates a bit of a problem, however, when trying to create reusable software components. If everything in your system depends on the logging component, this makes the software less reusable, basically forcing any downstream projects to take your logging framework along with the components they really want. </p> <p>IOC (dependency injection) doesn't really help with the problem since your components would need to depend on a logging abstraction. Logging components themselves can add dependencies on file I/O, triggering mechanisms, and other possibly unwanted dependencies. </p> <p>Does adding a dependency to your proprietary logging framework sacrifice the reusability of the component?</p>

I mean, content that is not static, that is updated often... The people that keep the site have to write every new entry in each supported language, and store each version of the entry in the database. The application loads only the entries in the user's chosen language.</p> <p>How do you design the database to support this kind of implementation?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>

In other words, I need a way from Windows to determine which drive the BIOS is using to boot the whole system. </p> <p>Does Windows expose an interface to discover this? With how big the Windows API is, I'm hoping there is something buried in there that might do the trick.</p> <p>Terry</p> <p>p.s. Just reading the first sectors of the hard disk isn't reveling anything. On my dev box I have two hard disks, and when I look at the contents of the first couple of sectors on either of the hard disks I have a standard boiler plate MBR.</p> <p>Edit to clarify a few things. The way I want to identify the device is with a string which will identify a physical disk drive (as opposed to a logical disk drive). Physical disk drives are of the form "\\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx" where x is a number. On the other hand, a logical drive is identified by a string of the form, "\\.\x" where x is a drive letter.</p> <p>Edit to discuss a few of the ideas that were thrown out. Knowing which logical volume Windows used to boot doesn't help me here. Here is the reason. Assume that C: is using a mirrored RAID setup. Now, that means we have at least two physical drives. Now, I get the mapping from Logical Drive to Physical Drive and I discover that there are two physical drives used by that volume. Which one did Windows use to boot? Of course, this is assuming that the physical drive Windows used to boot is the same physical drive that contains the MBR. </p>

I am trying to import this table to MySQL but nothing seems to work. I have tried the MySQL migration tool but that has a known issue with Access and OLE Objects. (The issue being it doesnt work and leaves the fields blank) I also tried the suggestion on <a href="http://www.plus2net.com/sql_tutorial/access_to_mysql.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this site</a> and while the data is imported it seems as though the image is getting corrupted in the transfer. When i try to preview the image i just get a binary view, if i save it on disk as a jpg image and try to open it i get an error stating the image is corrupt.</p> <p>The images in Access are fine and can be previewed. Access is storing the data as an OLE Object and when i import it to MySql it is saved in a MediumBlob field.</p> <p>Has anyone had this issue before and how did they resolve it ?</p>

3599851	1	How to transform a dataframe of characters to the respective dates? <p>I noticed already a couple of times that working with dates doesn't allow for using the usual tricks in R. Say I have a dataframe Data with Dates (see below), and I want to convert the complete dataframe to a date class. The only solution I could come up with until now is :</p> <pre><code>for (i in 1:ncol(Data)){ Data[,i] &lt;- as.Date(Data[,i],format="%d %B %Y") } </code></pre> <p>This gives a dataframe with the correct structure :</p> <pre><code>&gt; str(Data) 'data.frame': 6 obs. of 4 variables: $ Rep1:Class 'Date' num [1:6] 12898 12898 13907 13907 13907 ... $ Rep2:Class 'Date' num [1:6] 13278 13278 14217 14217 14217 ... $ Rep3:Class 'Date' num [1:6] 13600 13600 14340 14340 14340 ... $ Rep4:Class 'Date' num [1:6] 13831 13831 14669 14669 14669 ... </code></pre> <p>Using a classic apply approach gives something completely different. Although all variables are of the same class and go to the same class, I can't get a data-frame or matrix of the correct class as output :</p> <pre><code>&gt; str(sapply(Data,as.Date,format="%d %B %Y")) num [1:6, 1:4] 12898 12898 13907 13907 13907 ... - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ : NULL ..$ : chr [1:4] "Rep1" "Rep2" "Rep3" "Rep4" &gt; str(apply(Data,2,as.Date,format="%d %B %Y")) num [1:6, 1:4] 12898 12898 13907 13907 13907 ... - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ : NULL ..$ : chr [1:4] "Rep1" "Rep2" "Rep3" "Rep4" </code></pre> <p>If you want to transform these matrices again in Date objects, you need an origin. That origin can differ from system to system, so using as.Date or another function after the apply() doesn't help much either. If you apply the origin, you get a vector again. </p> <p>Anybody a clean solution for this kind of data? Below is the dataframe I used in the examples.</p> <pre><code>Data &lt;- structure(list(Rep1 = c(" 25 April 2005 ", " 25 April 2005 ", " 29 January 2008 ", " 29 January 2008 ", " 29 January 2008 ", " 29 January 2008 "), Rep2 = c(" 10 May 2006 ", " 10 May 2006 ", " 4 December 2008 ", " 4 December 2008 ", " 4 December 2008 ", " 4 December 2008 "), Rep3 = c(" 28 March 2007 ", " 28 March 2007 ", " 6 April 2009 ", " 6 April 2009 ", " 6 April 2009 ", " 6 April 2009 " ), Rep4 = c(" 14 November 2007 ", " 14 November 2007 ", " 1 March 2010 ", " 1 March 2010 ", " 1 March 2010 ", " 1 March 2010 ")), .Names = c("Rep1", "Rep2", "Rep3", "Rep4"), row.names = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"), class = "data.frame") </code></pre>

While we no longer support SQL Server 2000, it's possible that the code could get run on a machine that SQL Server 2000 and not have the SMO library installed. I would perfer to check for SMO first and degrade the functionality gracefully instead of blowing up in the user's face. What is best way to detect whether or not SMO is available on a machine?</p> <p>Every example that I have seen through a quick Google scan was a variation of "look for C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\SDK\Assemblies\Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll". The problem with that approach is that it only works with SQL Server 2005. If SQL Server 2008 is the only SQL Server installed then the path will be different.</p>

42557	0	Best way to incorporate spell checkers with a build process <p>I try to externalize all strings (and other constants) used in any application I write, for many reasons that are probably second-nature to most stack-overflowers, but one thing I would like to have is the ability to automate spell checking of any user-visible strings. This poses a couple problems:</p> <ul> <li>Not all strings are user-visible, and it's non-trivial to spearate them, and keep that separation in place (but it is <em>possible</em>)</li> <li>Most, if not all, string externalization methods I've used involve significant text that will not pass a spell checker such as aspell/ispell (eg: theStrName="some string." and comments)</li> <li>Many spellcheckers (once again, aspell/ispell) don't handle many words out of the box (generally technical terms, proper nouns, or just 'new' terminology, like metadata).</li> </ul> <p>How do you incorporate something like this into your build procedures/test suites? It is not feasible to have someone manually spell check all the strings in an application each time they are changed -- and there is <em>no chance</em> that they will all be spelled correctly the first time.</p>

I've taken on a project from a friend of mine and I am not sure what I need to know to get the project done. I suppose the issue is I don't know what I need to know to even get the project started.</p> <p>I do have many of the basics of object oriented programming, classes, methods and what-not, but when I sit down to code-I don't know where to begin looking to accomplish even basic tasks. I don't know syntax or what the language is capable of with the tools provided. I have read some books, but they mostly seem to be about the concepts and theories about OOP within C# with minimal syntax.</p> <p>I guess the question is where do I look to learn the syntax-is there some sort of repository of classes and methods that I am missing with examples of how to use the tools it contains?

3664493	1	ggplot: recommended colour palettes also distinguishable for B&W printing? <p>I've started to produce the charts for a paper. For some of them which are bar charts I've used the "Pastel1" palette (as recommended in the book on ggplot2, pastel colours are better than saturated ones for fill areas, such as bars).</p> <p>The problem with Pastel1 at least is that when printed on a B&amp;W laser printer, the colours are indistinguishable. I don't know if the readers will view the paper on screen or will print it on B&amp;W, so I'm looking for either of the following:</p> <ul> <li>how to <em>add hash lines</em> to a palette such as Pastel1 (hopefully the hash lines are also subtle)</li> <li><em>a colour palette easy on the eyes that also produces distinct grey areas for B&amp;W</em> for, say, up to 3-4 different colours.</li> </ul> <p>Granted, I could find the latter by experimenting and using toner, but perhaps this has already been solved, I suppose it's a common problem. And yes, I did google for this, but didn't find anything pertinent.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>

43199	0	Internationalized page properties in Tapestry 4.1.2 <p>The login page in my Tapestry application has a property in which the password the user types in is stored, which is then compared against the value from the database. If the user enters a password with multi-byte characters, such as:</p> <pre><code>áéíóú </code></pre> <p>...an inspection of the return value of getPassword() (the abstract method for the corresponding property) gives:</p> <pre><code>Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº </code></pre> <p>Clearly, that's not encoded properly. Yet Firebug reports that the page is served up in UTF-8, so presumably the form submission request would also be encoded in UTF-8. Inspecting the value as it comes from the database produces the correct string, so it wouldn't appear to be an OS or IDE encoding issue. I have not overridden Tapestry's default value for org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding in the .application file, and the Tapestry 4 <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for the property is UTF-8.</p> <p>So why does Tapestry appear to botch the encoding when setting the property?</p> <p>Relevant code follows:</p> <h2>Login.html</h2> <pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;html jwcid="@Shell" doctype='html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"' ...&gt; &lt;body jwcid="@Body"&gt; ... &lt;form jwcid="@Form" listener="listener:attemptLogin" ...&gt; ... &lt;input jwcid="password"/&gt; ... &lt;/form&gt; ... &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre> <h2>Login.page</h2> <pre class="lang-jsp prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE page-specification PUBLIC "-//Apache Software Foundation//Tapestry Specification 4.0//EN" "http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/dtd/Tapestry_4_0.dtd"&gt; &lt;page-specification class="mycode.Login"&gt; ... &lt;property name="password" /&gt; ... &lt;component id="password" type="TextField"&gt; &lt;binding name="value" value="password"/&gt; &lt;binding name="hidden" value="true"/&gt; ... &lt;/component&gt; ... &lt;/page-specification&gt; </code></pre> <h2>Login.java</h2> <pre><code>... public abstract class Login extends BasePage { ... public abstract String getPassword(); ... public void attemptLogin() { // At this point, inspecting getPassword() returns // the incorrectly encoded String. } ... } </code></pre> <h2>Updates</h2> <p>@Jan Soltis: Well, if I inspect the value that comes from the database, it displays the correct string, so it would seem that my editor, OS and database are all encoding the value correctly. I've also checked my .application file; it does not contain an org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding entry, and the Tapestry 4 <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for this property is UTF-8. I have updated the description above to reflect the answers to your questions.</p> <p>@myself: Solution found.</p>
43223	0	Running a Simulink xPC block at a faster rate than the continuous rate <p>I have a Simulink xPC target application that has blocks with discrete states at several different sample rates and some sections using continuous states. My intention on keeping the continuous states is for better numerical integration. </p> <p>What creates the problem: One block is reading a device at a very fast rate (500 hz). The rest of the application can and should run at a slower rate (say, 25 or 50 Hz) because it would be overkill to run it at the highest rate, and because the processor simply cannot squeeze a full application cycle into the .002 secs of the faster rate. So I need both rates. However, the continuous states run by definition in Simulink at the faster discrete rate of the whole application! This means everywhere I have continuous states now they're forced to run at 500 Hz when 25 Hz would do!</p> <p>Is there a way to force the continuous states in xPC target to a rate that is not the fastest in the application? Or alternatively, is there a way to allow certain block to run at a faster speed than the rest of the application?</p>

43890	0	Crop MP3 to first 30 seconds <p><strong>Original Question</strong></p> <p>I want to be able to generate a new (fully valid) MP3 file from an existing MP3 file to be used as a preview -- try-before-you-buy style. The new file should only contain the first <em>n</em> seconds of the track.</p> <p>Now, I know I could just "chop the stream" at <em>n</em> seconds (calculating from the bitrate and header size) when delivering the file, but this is a bit dirty and a real PITA on a VBR track. I'd like to be able to generate a proper MP3 file.</p> <p>Anyone any ideas?</p> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <p>Both <code>mp3split</code> and <code>ffmpeg</code> are both good solutions. I chose ffmpeg as it is commonly installed on linux servers and is also <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=205275&amp;package_id=248632" rel="noreferrer">easily available for windows</a>. Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg</p> <ul> <li><strong><code>-t &lt;seconds&gt;</code></strong> chop after specified number of seconds</li> <li><strong><code>-y</code></strong> force file overwrite</li> <li><strong><code>-ab &lt;bitrate&gt;</code></strong> set bitrate e.g. <em>-ab 96k</em></li> <li><strong><code>-ar &lt;rate Hz&gt;</code></strong> set sampling rate e.g. <em>-ar 22050</em> for 22.05kHz</li> <li><strong><code>-map_meta_data &lt;outfile&gt;:&lt;infile&gt;</code></strong> copy track metadata from infile to outfile</li> </ul> <p>instead of setting -ab and -ar, you can copy the original track settings, as Tim Farley suggests, with:</p> <ul> <li><strong><code>-acodec copy</code></strong></li> </ul>

44005	0	Propagation of Oracle Transactions Between C++ and Java <p>We have an existing C++ application that we are going to gradually replace with a new Java-based system. Until we have completely reimplemented everything in Java we expect the C++ and Java to have to communicate with each other (RMI, SOAP, messaging, etc - we haven't decided).</p> <p>Now my manager thinks we'll need the Java and C++ sides to participate in the same Oracle DB transaction. This is related to, but different from the usual distrbuted transaction problem of having a single process co-ordinate 2 transactional resources, such as a DB and a message queue.</p> <p>I think propagating a transaction across processes is a terrible idea from a performance and stability point-of-view, but I am still going to be asked for a solution.</p> <p>I am familiar with XA transactions and I've done some work with the JBoss Transaction Manager, but my googling hasn't turned up anything good on propagating an XA transaction between 2 processes.</p> <p>We are using Spring on the Java side and their documentation explicitly states they do not provide any help with transaction propagation.</p> <p>We are not planning on using a traditional Java EE server (for example: IBM Websphere), which may have support for propagation (not that I can find any definitive documentation).</p> <p>Any help or pointers on solutions is greatly appreciated.</p>

44080	0	Does Microsoft ASP.NET Ajax Cause DOM Object Leaks? <p>We've been using "Drip" to try and identify why pages with UpdatePanels in them tend to use a lot of client-side memory. With a page with a regular postback, we are seeing 0 leaks detected by Drip. However, when we add an update panel to the mix, every single DOM object that is inside of the update panel appears to leak (according to Drip).</p> <p>I am not certain is Drip is reliable enough to report these kinds of things - the reported leaks do seem to indicate Drip is modifying the page slightly. </p> <p>Does anyone have any experience with this? Should I panic and stop using Microsoft Ajax? I'm not above doubting Microsoft, but it seems fishy to me that it could be <em>this</em> bad.</p> <p>Also, if you know of a tool that is better than Drip, that would be helpful as well.</p>

44100	0	Best way to use a property to reference a Key-Value pair in a dictionary <p>This is a fairly trivial matter, but I'm curious to hear people's opinions on it.</p> <p>If I have a Dictionary which I'm access through properties, which of these formats would you prefer for the property?</p> <pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt; /// This class's FirstProperty property /// &lt;/summary&gt; [DefaultValue("myValue")] public string FirstProperty { get { return Dictionary["myKey"]; } set { Dictionary["myKey"] = value; } </code></pre> <p>This is probably the typical way of doing it. It's fairly efficient, easy to understand, etc. The only disadvantage is with a longer or more complex key it would be possible to misspell it or change only one instance or something, leading me to this:</p> <pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt; /// This class's SecondProperty property /// &lt;/summary&gt; [DefaultValue("myValue")] private const string DICT_MYKEY = "myKey" public string SecondProperty { get { return Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY]; } set { Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY] = value; } </code></pre> <p>Which is marginally more complicated, but seems to offer additional safety, and is closer to what I would think of as the "Code Complete" solution. The downside is that when you also have a /// block and a [DefaultValue()] block above the property already, it starts getting a bit crowded up there.</p> <p>So which do you like better, and why? Does anybody have any better ideas?</p>

44176	0	Searching subversion history (full text) <p>Is there a way to perform a full text search of a subversion repository, including all the history?</p> <p>For example, I've written a feature that I used somewhere, but then it wasn't needed, so I svn rm'd the files, but now I need to find it again to use it for something else. The svn log probably says something like "removed unused stuff", and there's loads of checkins like that.</p> <p><strong>Edit 2016-04-15:</strong> Please note that what is asked here by the term "full text search", is to <strong>search the actual diffs of the commit history, and not filenames and/or commit messages</strong>. I'm pointing this out because the author's phrasing above does not reflect that very well - since in his example he might as well be only looking for a filename and/or commit message. Hence a lot of the <code>svn log</code> answers and comments.</p>

So how do I avoid global state?</p> <p>The biggest things I use global state (as I understand it) for is managing key pieces of information between our development, acceptance, and production environments. For example, I have a static class named "Globals" with a static member called "DBConnectionString." When the application loads, it determines which connection string to load, and populates Globals.DBConnectionString. I load file paths, server names, and other information in the Globals class.</p> <p>Some of my functions rely on the global variables. So, when I test my functions, I have to remember to set certain globals first or else the tests will fail. I'd like to avoid this.</p> <p>Is there a good way to manage state information? (Or am I understanding global state incorrectly?)</p>
3736742	1	Calculating voting power indexes in R <p>I have a project in which i need to be able to calculate different voting power indexes in R. As a first attempt at this I wrote a small function to calculate the banzhaf index. It takes two arguments, a dataframe that has two columns which must be labelled member and vote, and how many votes are needed for a majority (quota):</p> <pre><code>library(combinat) banzhaf &lt;- function(data,quota){ f &lt;- vector() m &lt;- vector() score &lt;- vector() name &lt;- vector() pivot &lt;- vector() for (n in 1:nrow(data)){ y &lt;- as.matrix(combn(data$member,n)) for (i in 1:ncol(y)){ for ( j in 1:n){ f[j] &lt;- data[data$member == y[j,i],]$vote m[j] &lt;- as.character(data[data$member == y[j,i],]$member) o &lt;- data.frame(member = m, vote = f) } if (sum(o$vote) &gt;= quota){ for (k in 1:length(o$member)){ t &lt;- o[-k,] if (sum(t$vote) &lt; quota){ pivot[length(pivot) + 1] &lt;- as.character(o$member[k]) } } } } } for (l in unique(pivot)){ score[length(score) + 1] &lt;- sum(pivot == l) name[length(name) + 1] &lt;- l } out &lt;- data.frame(name = name, score = score/length(pivot)) return(out) } </code></pre> <p>The problem with this function is that it becomes incredibly slow when i have more than 8 members in the dataframe. This is due to the combn() function used in the outermost loop (I think). Does anyone know how this can be made to run faster?</p> <p>Best, Thomas</p> <p>P.S: If you want to test it use the following data, but beware that it might run forever!</p> <pre><code>x &lt;- c("Germany","France","UK","Italy","Spain","Poland","Romania","Netherlands","Greece","Portugal","Belgium","Czech Rep.","Hungary","Sweden","Austria","Bulgaria","Denmark","Slovakia","Finland","Ireland","Lithuania","Latvia","Slovenia","Estonia","Cyprus","Luxembourg","Malta") z &lt;- c(29,29,29,29,27,27,14,13,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,4,4,4,3) dat &lt;- data.frame(member = as.character(x),vote = z) oi &lt;- banzhaf(dat, 255) oi </code></pre>

44522	0	How to ensure that the same thread is used to execute code in IIS? <p>We have a third party dll that is used in our web service hosted in IIS6. The problem is that once this dll is loaded into memory, the exception <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.accessviolationexception.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AccessViolationException</a> gets thrown if a thread different then the one that created it tries to execute any code within the dll. The worker process is multi threaded and each call to the web service will get a random thread from the pool. We tried to unload it from memory and reload it each time we needed it, but I guess only the front end is .Net and the rest is unmanaged so it never actually gets completely unloaded from memory. We are using VB and .Net 2.0. Any suggestions?</p> <p>(Response to Rob Walker)</p> <p>We thought about creating a new thread and using it to call the dll, but how do we make the thread sit and wait for calls? How do you delegate the call to the thread without having the Dispatcher class supplied by .Net 3.0? Creating a hidden form and putting it in a message loop might work. And then we could call the Invoke() method of the form. But I can see many problems occurring if we create a form inside an IIS hosted web service.</p>

45013	0	Can the HTTP version or headers affect the visual appearance of a web page? <p>I know, I would have thought the answer was obviously "no" as well, but I am experiencing a strange situation where when I view my site from our staging server it appears slightly larger than when I view it from my local dev server. I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p> <p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p> <pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK Server WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2 Date Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT Vary Cookie Content-Length 2301 Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 </code></pre> <p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p> <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT Server Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch Vary Cookie Content-Length 2301 Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 </code></pre> <p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p> <p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is "zoomed in" by about 10%. For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide. Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p> <p>This is all in Firefox 3. I don't have any other browsers available to test with at the moment.</p> <p>Has anyone else encountered any bizarre behavior anything like this before? I am at a loss.</p>

45202	0	IoC Container Configuration/Registration <p>I absolutely need to use an IoC container for decoupling dependencies in an ever increasingly complex system of enterprise services. The issue I am facing is one related to configuration (a.k.a. registration). We currently have 4 different environments -- development to production and in between. These environments have numerous configurations that slightly vary from environment to environment; however, in all cases that <em>I can currently think of</em>, dependencies between components do not differ from environment to environment, though I could have missed something and/or this could obviously change. </p> <p>So, the ultimate question is, does anybody have a similar experience using an IoC framework? Or, can anybody recommend one framework over another that would provide flexible registration be it through some sort of convention or simplified configuration information? Would I still be able to benefit from a fluent interface or am I stuck with XML -- I'd like to avoid XML-hell.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is a .Net environment and I have been looking at Windsor, Ninject and Autofac. They all seem to now support both methods of registration (fluent and XML), though Autofac's support for lambda expressions seems to be a little different than the others. Anybody use that in a similar multi-deployment environment?</p>

3789260	1	How to Plot a Pre-Binned Histogram In R <p>I have a pre-binned frequency table for a rather large dataset. That is, a single column vector of bins and a single column vector of counts associated with those bins. I'd like R to plot a histogram of this data by doing further binning and summing the existing counts. For example, if in the pre-binned data I have something like [(0.01, 5000), (0.02, 231), (0.03, 948)], where the first number is the bin and the second is the count, and I choose 0.04 as the new bin width, I'd expect to get [(0.04, 6179)].

At the end of the program, the counter value should be zero.</p> <p>I know this is not a great way and there are a few catches. (For instance, if you are freeing memory which was allocated by a platform API call, your allocation count will not exactly match your freeing count. Of course, then we incremented the counter when calling API calls that allocated memory.)</p> <p>I am expecting your experiences, suggestions and maybe some references to tools which simplify this.</p>

45972	0	mmap() vs. reading blocks <p>I'm working on a program that will be processing files that could potentially be 100GB or more in size. The files contain sets of variable length records. I've got a first implementation up and running and am now looking towards improving performance, particularly at doing I/O more efficiently since the input file gets scanned many times.</p> <p>Is there a rule of thumb for using <code>mmap()</code> versus reading in blocks via C++'s <code>fstream</code> library? What I'd like to do is read large blocks from disk into a buffer, process complete records from the buffer, and then read more.</p> <p>The <code>mmap()</code> code could potentially get very messy since <code>mmap</code>'d blocks need to lie on page sized boundaries (my understanding) and records could potentially lie across page boundaries. With <code>fstream</code>s, I can just seek to the start of a record and begin reading again, since we're not limited to reading blocks that lie on page sized boundaries.</p> <p>How can I decide between these two options without actually writing up a complete implementation first?

46149	0	Best way to manage generated code in an automated build? <p>In my automated NAnt build we have a step that generates a lot of code off of the database (using SubSonic) and the code is separated into folders that match the schema name in the database. For example:</p> <ul> <li>/generated-code <ul> <li>/dbo <ul> <li>SomeTable.cs</li> <li>OtherTable.cs</li> </ul></li> <li>/abc <ul> <li>Customer.cs</li> <li>Order.cs </li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The schema names are there to isolate the generated classes that an app will need. For example, there is an ABC app, that will pull in the generated code from this central folder. I'm doing that on a pre-build event, like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>del /F /Q $(ProjectDir)Entities\generated*.cs</p> <p>copy $(ProjectDir)....\generated-code\abc*.cs $(ProjectDir)Entities\generated*.cs</p> </blockquote> <p>So on every build, the Nant script runs the generator which puts all the code into a central holding place, then it kicks off the solution build... which includes pre-build events for each of the projects that need their generated classes.</p> <p>So here's the friction I'm seeing:</p> <p>1) Each new app needs to setup this pre-build event. It kind of sucks to have to do this.</p> <p>2) In our build server we don't generate code, so I actually have an IF $(ConfigurationName) == "Debug" before each of those commands, so it doens't happen for release builds</p> <p>3) Sometimes the commands fail, which fails our local build. It will fail if: - there is no generated code yet (just setting up a new project, no database yet) - there is no existing code in the directory (first build)</p> <p>usually these are minor fixes and we've just hacked our way to getting a new project or a new machine up and running with the build, but it's preventing me from my 1-click-build Nirvana.</p> <p>So I'd like to hear suggestions on how to improve this where it's a bit more durable. Maybe move the copying of the code into the application folders into the NAnt script? This seems kind of backwards to me, but I'm willing to listen to arguments for it.</p> <p>OK, fire away :)</p>

That means I have n times 6 columns stored in a flat file.<br> Basically, I want to rearrange the data in a form that I only have a data.frame containing 6 columns but appending all the data from the file to the end of the first 6 columns. </p> <pre><code>Row 1V1 1V2 1V3 1V4 1V5 1V6 2V1 2V2 2V3 2V4 2V5 2V6 3V1... 1 2 </code></pre> <p>The result should look like that moving data from 2V1-2V6 to the end of 1V1-1V6 </p> <pre><code>Row V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 1-1 1-2 2-1 2-2 </code></pre> <p>I looked up some code snippets and could load the data into a data frame with all the vectors. Then I tried to create n dataframes containing always the repeating data structures. Then I tried to combine the single dataframes to a final one but it does not work.</p> <pre><code>df&lt;-read.table("test.txt",header = FALSE, sep = ";", skip = 2) columnmax=as.integer(ncol(df)/6) dfnew &lt;- vector(mode="list",length=columnmax) for ( i in 1:columnmax) { start&lt;-((i-1)*6+1) end&lt;-(i*6) dfnew[[i]]&lt;-df[,start:end] } y &lt;- do.call(rbind, dfnew) </code></pre> <p><strong>RESULT:</strong></p> <pre><code>Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) : names do not match previous names </code></pre> <p>I used the list mode because I didnt get it working to separate the dataframe otherwise. But it seems now to me that it makes the rbind to a problem because the "columnnames" are not identically. I havent not even an idea how to change the column names because its not a matrix in R termini but a list.

46777	0	How to control a web application through email? Or how to run php script by sending an email? <p>I want to run a web application on php and mysql, using the CakePHP framework. And to keep the threshold of using the site at a very low place, I want to not use the standard login with username/password. (And I don't want to hassle my users with something like OpenID either. Goes to user type.)</p> <p>So I'm thinking that the users shall be able to log in by sending an email to login@domain.com with no subject or content required. And they will get, in reply, an email with a link that will log them in (it will contain a hash). Also I will let the users do some actions without even visiting the site at all, just send an email with command@domain.com and the command will be carried out. I will assume that the users and their email providers takes care of their email account security and as such there is no need for it on my site.</p> <p>Now, how do I go from an email is sent to an account that is not read by humans to there being fired off some script (basically a "dummy browser client" calls an url( and the cakephp will take care of the rest)?</p> <hr> <p>I have never used a cron job before, but I do think I understand their purpose or how they generally work. I can not have the script be called by random people visiting the site, as that solution won't work for several reasons. I think I would like to hear more about the possibility of having the script be run as response to an email coming in, if anyone has any input at all on that. If it's run as a cron job it would only check every X minutes and users would get a lag in their response (if i understand it correctly). </p> <p>Since there will be different email addresses for different commands, like <strong>login</strong>@domain.com and I know what to do and how to do it to based on the sender email, i dont even need the content, subject or any other headers from the email.</p> <hr> <p>There is a lot of worry about security of this application, I understand the issues, but without giving away my concept, I dont think it is a big issue for what I am doing. Also about the usability issue, there really isnt any. It's just gonna be login to provide changes on a users profile if/when they need that and one other command. And this is the main email and is very easy to remember and the outset of this whole concept.</p>

In the code-behind for the page listing the messages I have the following code:</p> <pre><code>protected void MessageListDataSource_Selecting(object sender, LinqDataSourceSelectEventArgs e) { var db = new DataContext(); // parse the input strings from the web form int categoryIDFilter; DateTime dateFilter; string catFilterString = MessagesCategoryFilter.SelectedValue; string dateFilterString = MessagesDateFilter.SelectedValue; // TryParse will return default values if parsing is unsuccessful (i.e. if "all" is selected"): // DateTime.MinValue for dates, 0 for int DateTime.TryParse(dateFilterString, out dateFilter); Int32.TryParse(catFilterString, out categoryIDFilter); bool showRead = MessagesReadFilter.Checked; var messages = from detail in db.MessageDetails where detail.UserID == (int)Session["UserID"] where detail.Message.IsPublished where detail.Message.MessageCategoryID == categoryIDFilter || (categoryIDFilter == 0) where dateFilter == detail.Message.PublishDate.Value.Date || (dateFilter == DateTime.MinValue) // is unread, showRead filter is on, or message was marked read today where detail.IsRead == false || showRead || detail.ReadDate.Value.Date == DateTime.Today orderby detail.Message.PublishDate descending group detail by detail.Message.MessageCategory into categories orderby categories.Key.Name select new { MessageCategory = categories.Key, MessageDetails = categories.Select(d =&gt; d) }; e.Result = messages; } </code></pre> <p>This code <em>works</em>, but sticking a huge LINQ statement like this in the code-behind for a LinqDataSource control just doesn't sit right with me. </p> <p>It seems like I'm still coding queries into the user interface, only now it's LINQ instead of SQL. However, I feel that building another layer between the L2S classes and the UI would cut back on some of the flexibility of LINQ. Isn't the whole point to reduce the amount of code you write to fetch data?</p> <p>Is there some possible middle ground I'm not seeing, or am I just misunderstanding the way LINQ to SQL is supposed to be used? Advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Some of the code is already used in production so debugging it is not an easy task. Therefore I need a way to see in the database itself what SQL statements are used, as the statements are generated at runtime by the project and could be flawed when certain conditions are met. </p> <p>I therefore considered the possibility to monitor the incoming statements and check myself if I see any flaws. </p> <p>The database is running on a SQL Server 2005, and I use SQL server management studio express as primary tool to manipulate the database. So my question is, what is the best way to do this?</p>

The result is <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com" rel="noreferrer">BowlSK</a>. However, as it has grown, and features have been added, it has gotten really difficult to keep things organized - mainly due to the fact that this is my first python project, and I didn't know anything about it until I started working.</p> <p>What I have:</p> <ul> <li>Main Level contains: <ul> <li>all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)</li> <li>all .html templates for main level pages</li> </ul></li> <li>Subdirectories: <ul> <li>separate folders for css, images, js, etc.</li> <li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Example:<br/> <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/</a> maps to HomePage (default package), template at "index.html"<br/> <a href="http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130" rel="noreferrer">http://www.bowlsk.com/games/view-series.html?series=7130</a> maps to ViewSeriesPage (again, default package), template at "games/view-series.html"</p> <p>It's nasty. How do I restructure? I had 2 ideas:</p> <ul> <li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p> <ul> <li>Subfolder for code. Does this have to be my first package?</li> <li>Subfolder for templates. Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li> <li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li> </ul></li> <li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p> <ul> <li>Subfolder for code + templates. This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other. Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes? I'd like the folder to be "src", but I don't want my classes to be "src.WhateverPage"</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Is there a best practice? With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine? I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

3997546	1	Restricted optimization of custom functions in R <p>I have a complicated combined model for which I can define a likelihood in a function, and I need to optimize the parameters. Problem is, the parameters go all directions if not restricted. Hence, I need to implement a restriction on the parameters, and the one proposed by the professor is that the sum of squared parameter values should equal 1.</p> <p>I've been playing around with both the <code>optim()</code> and <code>nlm()</code> function, but I can't really get what I want. First idea was to use n-1 parameters and calculate the last one from the rest, but this doesn't work (as expected).</p> <p>To illustrate, some toy data and function reflecting the core problem of what I want to achieve:</p> <pre><code>dd &lt;- data.frame( X1=rnorm(100), X2=rnorm(100), X3=rnorm(100) ) dd &lt;- within(dd,Y &lt;- 2+0.57*X1-0.57*X2+0.57*X3+rnorm(100,0,0.2)) myfunc2 &lt;- function(alpha,dd){ alpha &lt;- c(alpha,sqrt(1-sum(alpha^2))) X &lt;- as.matrix(dd[,-4]) %*% alpha m.mat &lt;- model.matrix(~X) mod &lt;- glm.fit(m.mat,dd$Y) Sq &lt;- sum(resid(mod)^2) return(Sq) } b &lt;- c(1,0) optim(b,myfunc2,dd=dd) </code></pre> <p>This results obviously in :</p> <pre><code>Error: (subscript) logical subscript too long In addition: Warning message: In sqrt(1 - sum(alpha^2)) : NaNs produced </code></pre> <p>Anybody an idea on how to implement restrictions on parameters in optimization processes?</p> <p>PS: I am aware of the fact that this example code doesn't make sense at all.

4002011	1	Making sense of R-Hive, Elastic MapReduce, RHIPE and Distrubted Text mining with R <p>After having learned about MapReduce for solving a computer vision problem for my recent internship at Google, I felt like an enlightened person. I had been using R for text mining already. I wanted to use R for large scale text processing and for experiments with topic modeling. I started reading tutorials and working on some of those. I will now put down my understanding of each of the tools:</p> <p>1) R text mining toolbox: Meant for local (client side) text processing and it uses the XML library </p> <p>2) Hive: Hadoop interative, provides the framework to call map/reduce and also provides the DFS interface for storing files on the DFS. </p> <p>3) RHIPE: R Hadoop integrated environment</p> <p>4) Elastic MapReduce with R: a MapReduce framework for those who do not have their own clusters</p> <p>5) Distributed Text Mining with R: An attempt to make seamless move form local to server side processing, from R-tm to R-distributed-tm</p> <p>I have the following questions and confusions about the above packages</p> <p>1) Hive and RHIPE and the distributed text mining toolbox need you to have your own clusters. Right?</p> <p>2) If I have just one computer how would DFS work in case of HIVE </p> <p>3) Are we facing with the problem of duplication of effort with the above packages?</p> <p>I am hoping to get insights on the above questions in the next few days</p>

49263	0	Approximate string matching algorithms <p>Here at work, we often need to find a string from the list of strings that is the closest match to some other input string. Currently, we are using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The algorithm often returns a lot of false-positives (if we set the minimum-score too low), sometimes it doesn't find a match when it should (when the minimum-score is too high) and, most of the times, we need to check the results by hand. We thought we should try other alternatives.</p> <p>Do you have any experiences with the algorithms? Do you know how the algorithms compare to one another?</p> <p>I'd really appreciate some advice.</p> <p>PS: We're coding in C#, but you shouldn't care about it - I'm asking about the algorithms in general.</p> <hr> <p>Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to mention that.</p> <p>No, we're not using it to match duplicate data. We have a list of strings that we are looking for - we call it search-list. And then we need to process texts from various sources (like RSS feeds, web-sites, forums, etc.) - we extract parts of those texts (there are entire sets of rules for that, but that's irrelevant) and we need to match those against the search-list. If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).</p> <p>We can not perform the normal comparison, because the strings extracted from the outside sources, most of the times, include some extra words etc.</p> <p>Anyway, it's not for duplicate detection.</p>

Unfortunately, I've not used them in years (mainly because they're not supported by all modern browsers).

49737	0	Use-cases for reflection <p>Recently I was talking to a co-worker about C++ and lamented that there was no way to take a string with the name of a class field and extract the field with that name; in other words, it lacks reflection. He gave me a baffled look and asked when anyone would ever need to do such a thing.</p> <p>Off the top of my head I didn't have a good answer for him, other than "hey, I need to do it right now". So I sat down and came up with a list of some of the things I've actually done with reflection in various languages. Unfortunately, most of my examples come from my web programming in Python, and I was hoping that the people here would have more examples. Here's the list I came up with:</p> <ol> <li><p>Given a config file with lines like<br> x = "Hello World!"<br> y = 5.0<br> dynamically set the fields of some <code>config</code> object equal to the values in that file. (This was what I wished I could do in C++, but actually couldn't do.)</p></li> <li><p>When sorting a list of objects, sort based on an arbitrary attribute given that attribute's name from a config file or web request.</p></li> <li><p>When writing software that uses a network protocol, reflection lets you call methods based on string values from that protocol. For example, I wrote an IRC bot that would translate<br> <code>!some_command arg1 arg2</code><br> into a method call <code>actions.some_command(arg1, arg2)</code> and print whatever that function returned back to the IRC channel.</p></li> <li><p>When using Python's __getattr__ function (which is sort of like method_missing in Ruby/Smalltalk) I was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics, such as late_total. For every statistic, I wanted to be able to add _percent to get that statistic as a percentage of the total things I was counting (for example, stats.late_total_percent). Reflection made this very easy.</p></li> </ol> <p>So can anyone here give any examples from their own programming experiences of times when reflection has been helpful? The next time a co-worker asks me why I'd "ever want to do something like that" I'd like to be more prepared.</p>

4092425	1	Ensuring reproducibility in an R environment <p>I work in a computational biology lab, where we have several folks working on multiple projects, mostly in R (which is what I care about for this post). In the past, people would simply develop their code for each project, which may or may not involve boilerplate code copied over from previous projects. One thing that I've pushed over the years was to bring some centralized structure to this mess and have people identify common patterns such that we can turn these repeated/common blocks of code into packages for all of the many reasons one might think that is a good thing to do. So now our folks are using a mix of centralized packages/routines within their project specific scripts. </p> <p>There's one gotcha here. We have a mandate from the powers that be that every script for every project need to be 100% reproducible over time to the best of our ability (and this includes 100% of all code we have direct access to, including our packages). That is, if I call function foo in package bar with parameter A to get result X today, 4 years from now I should get the exact same result. (erroneous output due to bugs is excepted here)</p> <p>The topic of reproducibility has come up now and then in R within various circles, but typically it seems to be discussed in terms of reproducibility of process (e.g. vignettes). This is not the same thing - I can run a vignette today and then run the same code 6 months from now using updated packages and receive wildly different results.</p> <p>The solution that's been agreed upon (which I'm not a fan of) is that if a function or package needs to be changed in a non-backwards compatible change that it simply gets a new name. Thus, if we needed to radically change function foo(), it'd be called foo2(), and if that needs a radical change it gets called foo3(). This ensures that any script that called foo() will always get the original result, while allowing things to march forward within the package repository. It works, but I really dislike this - it seems aesthetically extremely cluttered, and I worry that it will lead to mass confusion over time having packages bar, bar2, bar3, bar4 ... functions foo1, foo2, foo3, etc. </p> <p>The problem is that I haven't come up with an alternate solution that's really better. One possibility would be to note version numbers of packages, R, etc and make sure those are loaded, but that has multiple problems - not the least of which is that it relies on proper package versioning discipline and that's prone to error. Also, this alternative was already rejected ;) Ideally what we'd have is some sort of notion of devel &amp; release as most of these changes tend to happen earlier on and then level off with changes happening much less frequently. OTOH what devel really means here is "not actually in a package yet" (which we do), but it can be hard to determine exactly at what point is the right one to transport stuff over.

At the moment I would be happy enough to simply change fonts to the 'courier' font family, but ultimately my goal is to call a custom font template--any input on this latter point would be very much appreciated. </p> <p>I've done a bit of homework, looking at the following posts and articles: </p> <ul> <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/browse_thread/thread/ba6272e20f626ecb?pli=1" rel="noreferrer">ggplot2: How to change font of labels in geom_text</a></li> <li><a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">R News Volume 6/2</a>, Non-Standard Fonts in PostScript and PDF Graphic, Murrell and Ripley.</li> <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ggplot2/tree/browse_frm/month/2009-01/f319138fbc4d6b12?rnum=41&amp;_done=%2Fgroup%2Fggplot2%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fmonth%2F2009-01%3F" rel="noreferrer">ComputerModern font in ggplot2 graphics?</a></li> </ul> <p>It may be because I am still a hopeless amateur with ggplot2, but I haven't even been able to switch chart fonts to courier.

50115	0	Using shadowbox disables keyboard shortcuts? <p>So my site uses <a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shadowbox</a> to do display some dynamic text. Problem is I need the user to be able to copy and paste that text. </p> <p>Right-clicking and selecting copy works but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> doesn't (no keyboard shortcuts do) and most people use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>? You can see an example of what I'm talking about <a href="http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. </p> <p>Just go to the "web" examples and click "inline". Notice keyboard shortcuts do work on the "this page" example. The only difference between the two I see is the player js files they use. "Inline" uses the html.js player and "this page" uses iframe.js. Also, I believe it uses the mootools library. Any ideas?</p>

The app has to tell the service what to do. So, assuming the communication is local only, what would be the best communication method for these two processes?<br /> By best I mean more robust and less error prone, not the best performance nor the easiest to code.</p> <p>Note I'm asking about what to use, a standard TCP socket, named pipes, or some other means of communication only.</p>
50164	0	How can I lock down my MS-SQL DB from my users and yet still access it through ODBC? <p>I've got an ms-access application that's accessing and ms-sql db through an ODBC connection. I'm trying to force my users to update the data <em>only</em> through the application portion, but I don't care if they read the data directly or through their own custom ms-access db (they use it for creating ad hoc reports).</p> <p>What I'm looking for is a way to make the data only editable if they are using the compiled .mde file I distribute to them. I know I can make the data read only for the general population, and editable for select users. </p> <p>Is there a way I can get ms-sql to make the data editable only if they are accessing it through the my canned mde?</p> <p>Thought, is there a way to get ms-access to log into the database as a different user (or change the login once connected)?</p> <hr> <p>@Jake,<br> Yes, it's using forms. What I'm looking to do is just have it switch users once when I have my launchpad/mainmenu form pop up.</p> <p>@Peter,<br> That is indeed the direction I'm headed. What I haven't determined was how to go about switching to that second ID. I'm not so worried about the password being sniffed, the users are all internal, and on an internal LAN. If they can sniff that password, they can certainly sniff the one for my privileged ID.</p> <p>@no one in general,<br> Right now its security by obscurity. I've given the uses a special .mdb for doing reporting that will let them read data, but not update it. They don't know about relinking to the tables through the ODBC connection. A slightly more ms-access/DB literate user could by pass what I've done in seconds - and there a few who imagine themselves to be DBA, so they will figure it out eventually.</p>
50170	0	Does "display: marker" work in any current browsers, and if so, how? <p>I can't be sure if my code is sucking, or if it's just that the browsers haven't caught up with the spec yet.</p> <p>My goal is to simulate list markers using generated content, so as to get e.g. continuation of the counters from list to list in pure CSS.</p> <p>So the code below, which I <em>think</em> is correct according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#markers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the spec</a>, is like this:</p> <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>html { counter-reset: myCounter; } li { counter-increment: myCounter; } li:before { content: counter(myCounter)".

Quirksmode.org isn't being its usual helpful self in this regard :(.</p>

Generally I got quite much nothing - <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2000-March/028122.html" rel="noreferrer">this old discussion list link</a> has a way to check if domain exist. Quite not what I was looking for... But still, it was best anwser Google gave me - everything else is just a bunch of unanwsered questions.</p> <p>Any of you have succeeded to get some method up and running? I'd very much appreciate some tips, or should I just do it the opensource-way, sit down and code something by myself? :) </p>

50528	0	Font-size independent UI: everything broke when I switched to 120 DPI? <p>So I was reading those Windows Vista UI guidelines someone linked to in another question, and they mentioned that you should be able to survive a switch to 120 DPI. Well, I fire up my handy VM with my app installed, and what do we get... AAAAGH!!! MASSIVE UI FAIL!</p> <p>Everything's all jumbled: some containers aren't big enough for their text; some controls that were positioned "next to each other" are now all squished together/spread apart; some buttons aren't tall enough; my <code>ListView</code> columns aren't wide enough... eeek.</p> <p>It sounds like a completely different approach is in order. My previous one was basically using the VS2008 Windows Forms designer to create, I guess, a pixel-based layout. I can see that if I were to stick with Windows Forms, <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code>s would be helpful, although I've found them rather inflexible in the past. They also don't solve the problem where the containers (e.g. the form itself) aren't big enough; presumably there's a way to do that? Maybe that <code>AutoSize</code> property?</p> <p>This might also be a sign that it's time to jump ship to WPF; I'm under the impression that it's specifically designed for this kind of thing.</p> <p>The basic issue seems to come down to these:</p> <ul> <li>If I were to stick with Windows Forms, what are all the tricks to achieving a font-size-independent layout that can survive the user setting his fonts large, or setting the display to 120 DPI?</li> <li>Does WPF have significant advantages here, and if so, can you try to convince me that it's worth the switch?</li> <li>Are there any general "best-practices" for font-size-independent layouts, either in the .NET stack or in general?</li> </ul>

50704	0	What is a good way to format logs? <p>I'm designing an application which includes the need to log all incoming messages I receive from a Telnet connection. The text is largely plain though can include ANSI tags that provide text colour and formatting (16 colours, bold, underline, etc).</p> <p>I'm would like to format my logs to store the text with formatting, date/time and potentially other meta data later. My first thoughts was all XML but this could impact my ability to write a fast search tool later. My current idea is Date/Time + text in one file with meta-data stored in another XML file, referenced by line number.</p> <p>Is this a good solution? Also, where and how should I store the formatting commands? The original ANSI tags would disrupt the plain but having them in two different files might be awkward.</p> <p>Additional: Thanks to some answers so far, though I should mention that most of the time the messages will be person to person communications rather than system messages. A more primitive IRC of sorts. Its up to my user to decide later (by adding meta data) which messages were important. This is the raw on the record log that filtered or edited logs might derive from.</p>

50747	0	Response.StatusCode and Internet Explorer - Display custom message? <p>I am implementing a HttpRequestValidationException in my Application_Error Handler, and if possible, I want to display a custom message.</p> <p>Now, I'm thinking about the StatusCode. In my current example, it sends a 200, which I think should not be done. I would like to send the (IMHO) more appropriate 400 Bad Request instead. However, at the same time, I would like to use Response.Write to enter a custom message. Firefox displays it properly, but IE7 gives me the Default unhelpful Internet Explorer Error Page.</p> <p>On one side, I guess that Internet Explorer just assumes that everything &lt;&gt; 200 is simply not having any &quot;good&quot; content, and the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-10.4.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC is not really clear</a> here.</p> <p>So I just wonder, is sending a HTTP 200 for an Error Page caused by a HttpRequestValidationException good practice or not?

(c++, win32)</p> <p>I have a manifest file such that my program uses the new WindowsXP themes (comctrl32 version 6).</p> <p>When I hover over a registered tool, the tip appears.<br> Good.<br> When I click the mouse, the tip disappears.<br> Ok.<br> However, moving away from the tool and back again does not make the tip re-appear. I need to hover over a different tool and then come back to my tool to get the tip to come back.</p> <p>When I remove my manifest file (to use the older non-XP comctrl32), the problem goes away.</p> <p>After doing some experimentation, I discovered the following differences between ToolTips in Comctl32 version 5 (old) and Comctl32 version 6 (new):</p> <ul> <li><p>New TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips (when used In-Place) actually return HTCLIENT from WM_NCITTEST if a mouse button is down, thus getting WM_LBUTTONDOWN and stealing focus for a moment before vanishing. This causes the application's border to flash.</p></li> <li><p>Old TTF_TRANSPARENT ToolTips always return HTTRANSPARENT from WM_NCHITTEST, and thus never get WM_LBUTTONDOWN themselves and never steal focus. (This seems to be just aesthetic, but may impact the next point...)</p></li> <li><p>New ToolTips seem not to get WM_TIMER events after a mouse-click, and only resume getting (a bunch of) timer events after being de-activated and re-activated. Thus, they do not re-display their tip window after a mouse click and release.</p></li> <li><p>Old ToolTips get a WM_TIMER message as soon as the mouse is moved again after click/release, so they are ready to re-display their tip.</p></li> </ul> <p>Thus, as a comctl32 workaround, I had to:</p> <ul> <li><p>subclass the TOOLTIPS_CLASS window and always return HTTRANSPARENT from WM_NCHITTEST if the tool asked for transparency.</p></li> <li><p>avoid using TTF_SUBCLASS and rather process the mouse messages myself so I could de-activate/re-activate upon receiving WM_xBUTTONUP.</p></li> </ul> <p>I assume that the change in internal behavior was to accommodate the new "clickable" features in ToolTips like hyperlinks, but the hover behavior appears to be thus broken.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a better solution than my subclass workaround? Am I missing some other point?</p>
51150	0	Why does clicking a child window not always bring the application to the foreground? <p>When an application is behind another applications and I click on my application's taskbar icon, I expect the entire application to come to the top of the z-order, even if an app-modal, WS_POPUP dialog box is open.</p> <p>However, some of the time, for some of my (and others') dialog boxes, only the dialog box comes to the front; the rest of the application stays behind.</p> <p>I've looked at Spy++ and for the ones that work correctly, I can see WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING being sent to the dialog's parent. For the ones that leave the rest of the application behind, WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING is not being sent to the dialog's parent.</p> <p>I have an example where one dialog usually brings the whole app with it and the other does not. Both the working dialog box and the non-working dialog box have the same window style, substyle, parent, owner, ontogeny.</p> <p>In short, both are WS_POPUPWINDOW windows created with DialogBoxParam(), having passed in identical HWNDs as the third argument.</p> <p>Has anyone else noticed this behavioral oddity in Windows programs? What messages does the TaskBar send to the application when I click its button? Who's responsibility is it to ensure that <em>all</em> of the application's windows come to the foreground?</p> <p>In my case the base parentage is an MDI frame...does that factor in somehow?</p>

51502	0	Improving Python readability? <p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p> <p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p> <p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p> <pre><code>if foo: bar = baz while bar not biz: bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life() did_i_not_warn_you_biz() my_father_is_avenged() </code></pre> <p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p> <pre><code>if foo: bar = baz while bar not biz: bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life() #-- while -- #-- if -- did_i_not_warn_you_biz() my_father_is_avenged() </code></pre> <p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

51649	0	How does off-the-shelf software fit in with agile development? <p>Maybe my understanding of agile development isn't as good as it should be, but I'm curious how an agile developer would potentially use off-the-shelf (OTS) software when the requirements and knowledge of what the final system should be are changing as rapidly as I understand them to (often after each iteration of development).</p> <hr> <p>I see two situations that are of particular interest to me:</p> <p>(1) An OTS system meets the initial set of requirements with little to no modification, other than potential integration into an existing system. However, within a few iterations of development, this system no longer meets the needs without rewriting the core code. The developers must choose to either spend additional time learning the core code behind this OTS software or throw it away and build from scratch. Either would have a drastic impact on development time and project cost.</p> <p>(2) The initial needs are not like any existing OTS system available, however, in the end when the customer accepts the product, it ends up being much like existing solutions due to requirement additions and subtractions. If the developers had more requirements and spent more time working on them up front, this solution could have been used instead of building again. The project was delivered, but later and at a higher cost than necessary.</p> <hr> <p>As a software engineer, part of my responsibilities (as I have been taught), are to deliver high-quality software to the customer on time at the lowest possible cost (among other things). Agile development allows for high-quality software, but in some cases, it might not be apparent that there are better alternatives until it is too late and too much money has been spent.</p> <p>My questions are:</p> <ol> <li>How does off-the-shelf software fit in with agile development?</li> <li>How do the agile manager and agile developer deal with these cases?</li> <li>What do the agile paradigms say about these cases?</li> </ol>
51654	0	(N)Hibernate - is it possible to dynamically map multiple tables to the one class <p>I have the situation where i use GIS software which stores the information about GIS objects into separate database table for each type/class of GIS object (road, river, building, sea, ...) and keeps the metadata table in which it stores info about the class name and its DB table.</p> <p>Those GIS objects of different classes share some parameters, i.e. Description and ID. I'd like to represent all of these different GIS classes with one common C# class (let's call it GisObject), which is enough for what i need to do from the non-GIS part of the application which lists GIS objects of the given GIS class.</p> <p>The problem for me is how to map those objects using NHibernate to explain to the NHibernate when creating a C# GisObject to receive and <strong>use the table name as a parameter</strong> which will be read from the meta table (it can be in two steps, i can manually fetch the table name in first step and then pass it down to the NHibernate when pulling GisObject data).</p> <p>Has anybody dealt with this kind of situation, and can it be done at all?</p>

51859	0	Using Makefile instead of Solution/Project files under Visual Studio (2005) <p>Does anyone have experience using makefiles for Visual Studio C++ builds (under VS 2005) as opposed to using the project/solution setup. For us, the way that the project/solutions work is not intuitive and leads to configuruation explosion when you are trying to tweak builds with specific compile time flags.</p> <p>Under Unix, it's pretty easy to set up a makefile that has its default options overridden by user settings (or other configuration setting). But doing these types of things seems difficult in Visual Studio.</p> <p>By way of example, we have a project that needs to get build for 3 different platforms. Each platform might have several configurations (for example debug, release, and several others). One of my goals on a newly formed project is to have a solution that can have all platform build living together, which makes building and testing code changes easier since you aren't having to open 3 different solutions just to test your code. But visual studio will require 3 * (number of base configurations) configurations. i.e. PC Debug, X360 Debug, PS3 Debug, etc.</p> <p>It seems like a makefile solution is much better here. Wrapped with some basic batchfiles or scripts, it would be easy to keep the configuration explotion to a minimum and only maintain a small set of files for all of the different builds that we have to do.</p> <p>However, I have no experience with makefiles under visual studio and would like to know if others have experiences or issues that they can share.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>(post edited to mention that these are C++ builds)</p>

He uses one of the less popular editors and I use another (I won't say which ones since it's not relevant and I want to avoid an editor flame war). I was saying that I didn't like his editor as much because it doesn't let you do find/replace with regular expressions.</p> <p>He said he's never wanted to do that, which was surprising since it's something I find myself doing all the time. However, off the top of my head I wasn't able to come up with more than one or two examples. Can anyone here offer some examples of times when they've found regex find/replace useful in their editor?

I tried to run this on my machine, and I got some error:</p> <p>[1] "\n\n Basic authentication is not supported\n\n" attr(,"Content-Type") charset "application/xml" "utf-8" Warning message: In postForm(request, .opts = opts) : No inputs passed to form</p> <blockquote> <p></p> </blockquote> <p>I'm wondering if there has been some changes on the twitter end of this, that make this code produce this error? I don't know too much about getting R to talk to webpages, so any guidance is much appreciated!! </p> <p>E</p>

4260698	1	R - ordering in boxplot <p>I am trying to produce a series of box plots in <strong>R</strong> that is grouped by 2 factors. I've managed to make the plot, but I cannot get the boxes to order in the correct direction.</p> <p>My data farm I am using looks like this:</p> <pre><code>Nitrogen Species Treatment 2 G L 3 R M 4 G H 4 B L 2 B M 1 G H </code></pre> <p>I tried:</p> <pre><code>boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~mydata$Species*mydata$Treatment) </code></pre> <p>this ordered the boxes alphabetically (first three were the "High" treatments, then within those three they were ordered by species name alphabetically).</p> <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTiGD.png" alt="alt text"></p> <p>I want the box plot ordered Low>Medium>High then within each of those groups G>R>B for the species.</p> <p>So i tried using a factor in the formula:</p> <pre><code>f = ordered(interaction(mydata$Treatment, mydata$Species), levels = c("L.G","L.R","L.B","M.G","M.R","M.B","H.G","H.R","H.B") </code></pre> <p>then:</p> <pre><code>boxplot(mydata$Nitrogen~f) </code></pre> <p>however the boxes are still shoeing up in the same order. The labels are now different, but the boxes have not moved.</p> <p>I have pulled out each set of data and plotted them all together individually:</p> <pre><code>lg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="L" &amp; mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] mg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="M" &amp; mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] hg = mydata[mydata$Treatment="H" &amp; mydata$Species="G", "Nitrogen"] etc .. boxplot(lg, lr, lb, mg, mr, mb, hg, hr, hb) </code></pre> <p>This gives what i want, but I would prefer to do this in a more elegant way, so I don't have to pull each one out individually for larger data sets.</p> <hr> <p>Loadable data:</p> <pre><code>mydata &lt;- structure(list(Nitrogen = c(2L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 2L, 1L), Species = structure(c(2L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L), .Label = c("B", "G", "R"), class = "factor"), Treatment = structure(c(2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 1L), .Label = c("H", "L", "M"), class = "factor")), .Names = c("Nitrogen", "Species", "Treatment"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -6L)) </code></pre>

52563	0	Input type=text to fill parent container <p>I'm trying to let an <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> (henceforth referred to as “textbox”) fill a parent container by settings its <code>width</code> to <code>100%</code>. This works until I give the textbox a padding. This is then added to the content width and the input field overflows. Notice that in Firefox this only happens when rendering the content as standards compliant. In quirks mode, another box model seems to apply.</p> <p>Here's a minimal code to reproduce the behaviour in all modern browsers.</p> <p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false"> <div class="snippet-code"> <pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>#x { background: salmon; padding: 1em; } #y, input { background: red; padding: 0 20px; width: 100%; }</code></pre> <pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;div id="x"&gt; &lt;div id="y"&gt;x&lt;/div&gt; &lt;input type="text"/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre> </div> </div> </p> <p>My question: <strong>How do I get the textbox to fit the container?</strong></p> <p><em>Notice</em>: for the <code>&lt;div id="y"&gt;</code>, this is straightforward: simply set <code>width: auto</code>. However, if I try to do this for the textbox, the effect is different and the textbox takes its default row count as width (even if I set <code>display: block</code> for the textbox).</p> <p>EDIT: David's solution would of course work. However, I do not want to modify the HTML – I do especially not want to add dummy elements with no semantic functionality. This is a typical case of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Citations:divitis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">divitis</a> that I want to avoid at all cost. This can only be a last-resort hack.</p>

52674	0	Simplest way to reverse the order of strings in a make variable <p>Let's say you have a variable in a makefile fragment like the following:</p> <pre><code>MY_LIST=a b c d </code></pre> <p>How do I then reverse the order of that list? I need:</p> <pre><code>$(warning MY_LIST=${MY_LIST}) </code></pre> <p>to show</p> <pre><code>MY_LIST=d c b a </code></pre> <p>Edit: the real problem is that </p> <pre><code>ld -r some_object.o ${MY_LIST} </code></pre> <p>produces an <code>a.out</code> with undefined symbols because the items in <code>MY_LIST</code> are actually archives, but in the wrong order. If the order of <code>MY_LIST</code> is reversed, it will link correctly (I think). If you know a smarter way to get the link order right, clue me in.</p>
4270926	1	Change the class of columns in a data frame <p>First of all, excuse me if I do any mistakes, but English is not a language I use very often.</p> <p>I have a data frame with numbers. A small part of the data frame is this:</p> <p>nominal 2 2 2 2 </p> <p>ordinal 2 1 1 2</p> <p>So, I want to use the gower distance function on these numbers.</p> <p>Here ( <a href="http://rgm2.lab.nig.ac.jp/RGM2/R_man-2.9.0/library/StatMatch/man/gower.dist.html" rel="nofollow">http://rgm2.lab.nig.ac.jp/RGM2/R_man-2.9.0/library/StatMatch/man/gower.dist.html</a> ) says that in order to use gower.dist, all nominal variables must be of class "factor" and all ordinal variables of class "ordered".</p> <p>By default, all the columns are of class "integer" and mode "numeric". In order to change the class of the columns, i use these commands:</p> <pre><code> DF=read.table("clipboard",header=TRUE,sep="\t") # I select all the cells and I copy them to the clipboard. #Then R, with this command, reads the data from there. MyHeader=names(DF) # I save the headers of the data frame to a temp matrix for (i in 1:length(DF)) { if (MyHeader[[i]]=="nominal") DF[[i]]=as.factor(DF[[i]]) } for (i in 1:length(DF)) { if (MyHeader[[i]]=="ordinal") DF[[i]]=as.ordered(DF[[i]]) } </code></pre> <p>The first for/if loop changes the class from integer to factor, which is what I want, but the second changes the class of ordinal variables to: "ordered" "factor".</p> <p>I need to change all the columns with the header "ordinal" to "ordered", as the gower.dist function says.</p> <p>Thanks in advance, B.T.</p>

Most of these are fairly descriptive and help me find the problem very quickly (I use the MS Application Exception Block). </p> <p>On a few occasions I have reports that are issues that I can't reproduce, and seem to only happen on a few client machines. </p> <p>I don't have physical access to these client machines, what are some strategies I can use for debugging? Would it be better to build some tracing into the code, or are there some other alternatives?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>Edit: I should have been more clear: The error reports that I get do have the stack trace, but since it's production code, it doesn't indicate the exact line that caused the exception, just the method in which it was thrown.</p>

52924	0	Separating CSS deployment from rest of site <p>Where I work, the design and development departments are totally separated, however we (the design department) are responsible for managing the CSS for our sites. Typically, new CSS needs to be released to the production server far more often than new website code. Because of this, we are deploying the CSS separately, and it lives outside source control.</p> <p>However, lately, we've run into a few problems with new CSS not being synched for up site releases, and in general the process is a huge headache. I've been pushing to get the CSS under some kind of source control, but having trouble finding a good deployment method that makes everyone happy. Our biggest problem is managing changes that affect current portions of the site, where the CSS changes need to go live before the site changes, but not break anything on the exisiting site.</p> <p>I won't go into the finer details of the weird culture between designers and devs here, but I was wondering what experience others have had in managing large amounts of CSS (50+ files, thousands and thousands of lines) that needs to be constantly updated and released independent of site releases.</p>

4320980	1	Group rows by attributes <p>I have a data frame containing data about student lateness to various classes. Each row contains data about a late student and his class: date and time of the class, name of the class, class size, number of minutes late, and the gender of the student. In order to get the total percentage of late students for all classes, I need to count the number of rows (late students) and compare that with the total number of students that attended class.</p> <p>I can't simply sum the class sizes for all of the rows; that would count the students of a given class several times, once for each late student in the class. Instead, I need to count each class size only once for each meeting of the class. </p> <h3>Example</h3> <p>Key: minutes late, class name, students in attendance, gender of tardy student, minutes late.</p> <pre><code>11/12/10 Stats 30 M 1 11/12/10 Stats 30 M 1 11/12/10 Stats 30 M 1 11/15/10 Stats 40 F 3 11/15/10 Stats 40 F 3 11/15/10 Stats 40 F 3 11/16/10 Radar 22 M 2 11/16/10 Radar 22 M 2 11/16/10 Radar 22 M 2 11/16/10 Radar 22 M 2 11/16/10 Radar 22 M 2 </code></pre> <p>In this case, there are three different class meetings and 11 late students.

53802	0	What is the best tool to benchmark my JavaScript? <p>I'm currently working on a JavaScript tool that, during the course of its execution, will ultimately traverse each node in the DOM. Because this has potential to be a very expensive task, I'd like to benchmark the performance of this script.</p> <p>What's the best, free tool for benchmarking a script such as this across the major browsers? Ideally, I'd like the tool (or set of tools, even):</p> <ul> <li> **To generate some form of report based on the results of the test.** It can be as simple as a table showing execution times, or as complex as generating some form of a chart. Either way is fine. </li> <li> **To be free.** it's not that I don't believe in paying for software, it's just that I don't have a major need for a tool like this in my typical day-to-day tasks. </li> </ul> <p>If possible, I'd also like the tool to generate varying levels of complex pages so that I can stress test a set of DOMs. This isn't a necessity - if I need to do so, I can write one myself; however, I'd figure I'd poll the community first to see if something already exists.</p>

53913	0	How can I lay images out in a grid? <p>I'm trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using XSLT and XSL-FO. The photo URLs and captions are produced using a FOR XML query against an SQL Server database, and the number of photos returned varies from sheet to sheet. I want to lay the photos out in four columns, filling the grid from left to right and from top to bottom. In HTML I'd do this by putting each photo and caption into a div and using "float: left" to make them flow into the grid. Is there a similarly elegant method using XSL-FO?</p>

4363799	1	how, in R, to plot time of day versus calendar date <p>I regret that I come to post here after being burned-out on hours of Internet searching regarding this simplistic question.</p> <p>I have several data sets to plot in R, each consisting of two columns of data: time, date. I am using R 2.11.0 on a Windows computer, via the Rgui.</p> <p>Time is "time of day" that an event is observed. As an example, it is recognized as:</p> <pre><code>Factor w/ 87 levels "5:53","5:54",..: 84 85 85 85 86 ... </code></pre> <p>Date is calendar date, recognized as:</p> <pre><code>Class 'Date' num [1:730] 13879 13880 13881 13882 13883 ... </code></pre> <p>The time values are recorded in the format of a 24-hr clock, h:mm or hh:mm. The date values are displayed yyyy-mm-dd.</p> <p>I want to plot time (y-axis) vs. date (x-axis). </p> <p>Using </p> <pre><code>plot(date,time) </code></pre> <p>gives an accurate-looking plot, but the y-axis is labeled as the numeric factor values (about 0 to 90), rather than the desired, temporally-ordered levels of the factor variable. The x-axis is labeled in the desired, human-readable format.</p> <p>How can I correct this? Is there a "time of day" format in R that I can convert my "time" variable into? I will subsequently like to do arithmetic on the time values as well, and would not mind having to carry one column of values to use in plotting and one column of values for maths.</p> <p>I ran across several examples online of manipulation of (date + time) variables in R, and converting those to different formats. I do not believe this is my problem, as I have separate fields for time and date and want to plot one against the other.</p> <p>My thanks to you in advance for your suggestions, or your directions to a web-accessible resource (no appropriate libraries or bookstores at my location).</p>
54337	0	How can you find out where the style for a ASP .Net web page element came from? <p>I have a quandary. My web application (C#, .Net 3.0, etc) has Themes, CSS sheets and, of course, inline style definitions. Now that's alot of chefs adding stuff to the soup. All of this results, not surprisingly, in my pages having bizarre styling on occasion.</p> <p>I am sure that all these styles are applied in a hierarchical method (although I am not sure of that order). The issue is that each style is applied as a "transparent" layer which just masks what it is applying. This is, I feel, a good idea as you can specifiy styles for the whole and then one-off them as needed. Unfortunately I can't tell from which layer the style actually came from.</p> <p>I could solve this issue by explicitly expressing the style at all layers but that gets bulky and hard to manage and the page(s) works 80% of the time. I just need to figure out where that squirrelly 20% came from.</p>

Apparently, ifelse can access information that should be hidden.</p> <p>Say we do :</p> <pre><code>&gt; x &lt;- expression(dd &lt;- 1:3) &gt; y &lt;- expression(dd &lt;- 4:6) &gt; z &lt;- c(1,0) &gt; eval(x) &gt; eval(y) &gt; </code></pre> <p>We get no output.

But strangely enough, when you try the funny code</p> <pre><code>&gt; ifelse(z==0,eval(x),eval(y)) [1] 4 2 </code></pre> <p>You get output??? Somebody has an explanation for this?</p> <p>It's not as simple as "R evaluates and then uses dd".

4377507	1	R quantmod package behaves differently when executed from console versus from TextMate <p>Here is the code:</p> <pre><code>require("quantmod") getSymbols("GLD") getSymbols("SLV") getSymbols("TLT") GSR = GLD/SLV par(mfrow=c(2,2)) chartSeries (GLD, subset="2010", TA = NULL) chartSeries (SLV, subset="2010", TA = NULL) chartSeries (TLT, subset="2010", TA = NULL) chartSeries (GSR, subset="2010", TA = NULL) </code></pre> <p>When I run this file from TextMate with the Command R keystroke, I get four charts lined up in a 2 x 2 grid, as you'd expect from the par() function. When I source this from the R console, </p> <pre><code>&gt; source("~/myChartSeries.r") </code></pre> <p>I get a flash of each chart with the last one depicted alone. The last I'd heard, chartSeries() was not compliant with the par() function but chart_Series() is. So the behavior of the console is not surprising. But why does execution from TextMate work? Has chartSeries() been made par() compliant and is the R console execution flawed?</p>

54980	0	How do prepared statements work? <p>I'm writing some DB routines and I'm using prepared statements. My environment is PDO with PHP5.</p> <p>I understand prepared statements primarily provide a performance benefit, as well as some auxiliary bonuses such as not having to manually SQL-escape input data.</p> <p>My question is about the performance part.</p> <p>I have two implementations of a getPrice function below that takes a product id and returns its price.</p> <p>getPrice_A reuses the same PDOStatement object across subsequent calls within the same script execution. Is this necessary or recommended? If so, is there any way to avoid duplicating this extra code across every single get*() in every single model?</p> <p>getPrice_B creates a new PDOStatement object on every call. Will the DBMS recognize this statement has already been prepared and still be able to skip some work? In other words, does this implementation properly take advantage of the performance benefits of prepared statements?</p> <p>Having written all this out and read it over, I imagine getPrice_B is fine and getPrice_A is providing a negligible benefit on top of that, which may or may not be worth the extra complication.</p> <p>I'd still like to hear for sure from someone more knowledgable though.</p> <p>Assume that <code>$pdo</code> is a valid, connected PDO object in the examples below.</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php class Product { static function &amp;getPrice_A($id) { static $stmt; if (!$stmt) { $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = ?'); } $stmt-&gt;execute(array($id)); return $stmt-&gt;fetchColumn(0); } static function &amp;getPrice_B($id) { $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = ?'); $stmt-&gt;execute(array($id)); return $stmt-&gt;fetchColumn(0); } } // example usage: $price = Product::getPrice(4982); echo "Product 4982 costs $price\n"; </code></pre>

55639	0	How do you communicate between Windows Vista Session 0 and Desktop? <p>In prior versions of Windows before Vista you could have a Windows Service interact with the current logged in desktop user to easy display information on the screen from the service. In Windows Vista Session 0 was added for security to isolate the services from the desktop. What is an easy way to communicate between a service and an application running outside of Session 0? So far I have gotten around this by using TCP/IP to communicate between the two but it seems to be kind of a sloppy way to do it.</p>
55692	0	.NET namespaces <p>My background is primarily as a Java Developer, but lately I have been doing some work in .NET. So I have been trying to do some simple projects at home to get better at working with .NET. I have been able to transfer much of my Java experience into working with .NET (specifically C#), but the only thing that has really perplexed me is namespaces.</p> <p>I know namespaces are similar to Java packages, but as from what I can tell the main difference is that with Java packages they use actual file folders to show the seperation, while in .NET it does not and all the files reside in a single folder and the namespace is simply declared in each class.</p> <p>I find this odd, because I always saw packages as a way to organize and group related code, making it easier to navigate and comprehend. Since in .NET it does not work this work this way, overtime, the project appears more overcrowded and not as easy to navigate.</p> <p>Am I missing something here? I have to be. Should I be breaking things into separate projects within the solution? Or is there a better way to keep the classes and files organized within a project?</p> <p>Edit: As Blair pointed out this is pretty much the same question asked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4664/should-the-folders-in-a-solution-match-the-namespace">here</a>.</p>

55862	0	How to implement password protection for individual files? <p>I'm writing a little desktop app that should be able to encrypt a data file and protect it with a password (i.e. one must enter the correct password to decrypt). I want the encrypted data file to be self-contained and portable, so the authentication has to be embedded in the file (or so I assume).</p> <p>I have a strategy that appears workable and seems logical based on what I know (which is probably just enough to be dangerous), but I have no idea if it's actually a good design or not. So tell me: is this crazy? Is there a better/best way to do it?</p> <ul> <li>Step 1: User enters plain-text password, e.g. "MyDifficultPassword" </li> <li>Step 2: App hashes the user-password and uses that value as the symmetric key to encrypt/decrypt the data file. e.g. "MyDifficultPassword" --> "HashedUserPwdAndKey". </li> <li>Step 3: App hashes the hashed value from step 2 and saves the new value in the data file header (i.e. the unencrypted part of the data file) and uses that value to validate the user's password. e.g. "HashedUserPwdAndKey" --> "HashedValueForAuthentication"</li> </ul> <p>Basically I'm extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords (when you're not using OpenID, that is), which is to store the (salted) hash of the user's password in your DB and never save the actual password. But since I use the hashed user password for the symmetric encryption key, I can't use the same value for authentication. So I hash it again, basically treating it just like another password, and save the doubly-hashed value in the data file. That way, I can take the file to another PC and decrypt it by simply entering my password.</p> <p>So is this design reasonably secure, or hopelessly naive, or somewhere in between? Thanks!</p> <p>EDIT: clarification and follow-up question re: Salt.<br> I thought the salt had to be kept secret to be useful, but your answers and links imply this is not the case. For example, <a href="ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2-0.pdf" rel="noreferrer">this spec</a> linked by erickson (below) says: </p> <blockquote> <p>Thus, password-based key derivation as defined here is a function of a password, a salt, and an iteration count, where the latter two quantities need not be kept secret.</p> </blockquote> <p>Does this mean that I could store the salt value in the same place/file as the hashed key and still be more secure than if I used no salt at all when hashing? How does that work?</p> <p>A little more context: the encrypted file isn't meant to be shared with or decrypted by others, it's really single-user data. But I'd like to deploy it in a shared environment on computers I don't fully control (e.g. at work) and be able to migrate/move the data by simply copying the file (so I can use it at home, on different workstations, etc.).</p>

56005	0	.NET serialization class design issue <p>We have a rather large object graph that needs to be serialized and deserialized in a lot of different ways (modes). In some modes we want certain properties to be deserialized and in some we don't. In future modes it might also be possible that there are more options for properties than yes or no. The problem is now how we implement these modes. </p> <p><strong>Approach A (use deserialization constructor and ISerializable.GetObjectData):</strong></p> <p>If we let each object of the graph serialize itself using a deserialization constructor we get a lot switches for all the different modes of deserialization. The advantage of this approach however is that all the deserialization logic is at one location and if we add new properties we just need to modify the ISerializable.GetObjectData and the deserialization constructor. Another advantage is that the object might take internal states into account that might be exposed publically. The most important disadvantage is that we dataobject itself needs to know about all possible serialization modes. If we need a new mode we need to modify the dataobjects.</p> <p><strong>Approach B (Deserialization Factory Classes/Methods ):</strong></p> <p>Another approach would be to have some sort Deserialization Factory Classes/Methods one for each mode that does the serialization and deserialization externally (e.g. GraphSerializer.SerializeObjectTypeX(ObjectTypeX objectToSerialze). The advantage here is that whenever we want a new mode we just add a new Factory Class/Method and our Dataobject do not get cluttered with all the serialization modes that get introduced. The main disadvantage here is that I would have to write the same serialization code over and over for all the different modes. If two modes differ just in one or two properties but I would have to implement the complete logic for the whole graph again. When I add a new property to a dataobject I need to update all the factory classes.</p> <p>So I wonder if there is a better approach to this IMHO general problem. Or even a best practise in .NET? Or maybe I am just approaching the whole thing from a wrong perspective?</p>

56224	0	Creating objects driven by the database to populate a Treeview - very slow <p>I have an application that reads a table from a database. </p> <p>I issue an SQL query to get a result set, based on a unique string value I glean from the results, I use a case/switch statement to generate certain objects (they inherit TreeNode BTW). These created objects get shunted into a Dictionary object to be used later.</p> <p>Whilst generating these objects I use some of the values from the result set to populate values in the object via the setters.</p> <p>I query the Dictionary to return a particular object type and use it to populate a treeview. However it is not possible to populate 2 objects of the same type in a treeview from the Dictionary object (you get a runtime error - which escapes me at the moment, something to with referencing the same object). So what I have to do is use a memberwiseClone and implement IClonable to get around this. </p> <p>Am I doing this right? Is there a better way - because I think this is causing my program to be real slow at this point. At the very least I think its a bit clunky - any advice from people who know more than me - greatly appreciated.</p>

56716	0	Architecture for modeling <p>A common solution to building a model of a system which consists of many items of different types is to create a modular system, where each module is responsible for particular type. For example, there will be module for wombats WombatModule:IModule, where IModule interface has methods like GetCount() (to find number of wombats) and Update() (to update all wombats' state).</p> <p>More object-oriented approach would be to have class for every item type and create an instance for every item. That will make class Wombat:IItem with methods like Update() (to update this one wombat).</p> <p>From code perspective difference is negligible, but run-time is significantly different. Module-oriented solution is certainly faster: less object creation, easier to optimize operations common for all wombats. </p> <p>Problems come when number of types and modules grow. Either you lose most of performance advantage because each module only supports several items, or modules' complexity grows to accomodate for slightly different items of one general type - say, fat and slim wombats. Or both.</p> <p>At least once I've seen it degrade into poor state when all WombatModule does is keep a collection of hidden Wombat objects and run their methods in loop.</p> <p>When performance is less of a problem than long-term development, can you identify any architectural reasons to use modules instead of per-item objects? May be there's another possibility I'm missing?</p>

(I've tried this in Firefox 3.0 on Windows as well, also to no avail.) The tag looks like this: </p> <pre><code>&lt;td&gt; &lt;canvas id="display" width="500px" height="500px"&gt; &lt;/canvas&gt; &lt;/td&gt; </code></pre> <p>I have a button to "activate" some functionality that interacts with the canvas. That button's <code>onclick()</code> event calls a function. In that function I have the following line:</p> <pre><code>document.getElementById("display").focus(); </code></pre> <p>This does not work. Firebug reports no error. But the focus still remains where it was. I can click on the canvas or tab towards the canvas and focus will be lost from the other elements, but apparently never be gained on by the canvas (The canvas's <code>onfocus()</code> event never fires). </p> <p>I find this odd. Is it that the canvas simply cannot get focus, or am I missing something here? Any insight would be appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>

Whether they attend or not depends on a number of parameters, including whether they attended the previous session (which is in <code>patients</code>), what "class" of patient they are (which is in <code>classlist</code>), how many sessions they have already either attended or skipped (<code>invited</code>) and how many sessions in a row they have missed (<code>missinrow</code>); all of those will vary. If the previous session is less than full, additional patients get assigned to the new session (provided someone is waiting (<code>waitlist</code>). </p> <p>When I do this one patient at a time, it works well. But when I try to loop over all patients, I run into the </p> <p>Hello</p> <p>This is one part of a larger program. I cannot figure out why it doesn't work as I thought it would. The code is</p> <pre><code>for(i in 2:p) { while (insess[1] &lt; maxses &amp; waitlist[1] &gt; 0) { invited[i,1] &lt;- 1 waitlist[1] &lt;- waitlist[1] - 1 insess[1] &lt;- insess[1] + 1 if (classlist[i] == "D") { if (runif(1) &lt; dropnew) {patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'A'} else { patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'S' missinrow[i, 1] &lt;- 1 } } if (classlist[i] == "T") { if (runif(1) &lt; titratenew) {patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'A'} else { patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'S' missinrow[i, 1] &lt;- 1 } } if (classlist[i] == "C") { if (runif(1) &lt; completenew) {patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'A'} else { patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'S' missinrow[i, 1] &lt;- 1 } } if (classlist[i] == "N") { if (runif(1) &lt; noisenew) {patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'A'} else { patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'S' missinrow[i, 1] &lt;- 1 } } if (classlist[i] == "O") { if (runif(1) &lt; othernew) {patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'A'} else { patients[i, 1] &lt;- 'S' missinrow[i, 1] &lt;- 1 } } } } </code></pre> <p>When I run this, i goes to 30 (which is right), insess[1] goes to 10 (also right), waitlist[1] goes to 0 (also right) but the patients matrix is only updated for i = 2. I also checked that classlist has appropriate values.</p> <p>I don't see where it is leaving the loop. I think I'm using while incorrectly, but not sure how.</p> <p>thanks!</p>

I am using jQuery to make an AJAX call to fill in a drop-down dynamically given the user's previous input (from another drop-down, that is filled server-side).

57739	0	What is the best workaround for the ASP.NET forms authentication timeout when using wildcard mapping? <p>My team is working on a crappy old website and most of the pages are still ASP classic. However, we've recently migrated to forms authentication using ASP.NET and wildcard mapping. Everything works surprisingly well except for one thing: logged in users are timing out too quickly. After looking in the logs it appears people are timing out exactly after 20 minutes (which is the specified timeout due to inactivity). </p> <p>So, our hypothesis is that the ASP classic pages are not tripping whatever mechanism in the forms authentication framework that resets the inactivity timer. I've googled around and even read the wildcard mapping post by the Great Gu but still can't find anyone else who is having this problem. So, 1) Have you ever seen this problem? and 2) What's the best workaround? (other than manually placing a hidden frame in every janky ASP page that loads a dumb .NET page in the background)</p> <p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>slidingExpiration</em> is set to <em>true</em> </p> <p><strong>Also</strong>: We can't use perpetual sessions because we need the application to time out after 20 minutes of inactivity. Also, this terrible site was written so that the interface is usually stored in the page. There's no simple piece of interface code I could slip the JavaScript into. We tried to put some js into an include file that was called by about 80% of our pages but it's caused some esoteric problems with file download buffers so we may have to try a different tack. Thanks. </p>
57762	0	Step-By-Step ASP.NET Automated Build/Deploy <p>Seems like there are so many different ways of automating one's build/deployment that it becomes difficult to parse through all the different scenarios that people support in tutorials on the web. So I wanted to present the question to the stackoverflow crowd ... what would be the best way to set up an automated build and deployment system using the following configuration:</p> <ul> <li>Visual Studio 2008</li> <li>Web Application Project</li> <li>CruiseControl.NET</li> </ul> <p>One of the first things I tried was to have CCnet automatically zip the output and copy it to the server, but then that requires manual work to unzip at the destination. However, if we try to copy all the files individually, then it could potentially take a long time if it's a large application (build server lives outside of the datacenter in our office ... I know).</p> <p>Also of particular interest is how we would support multiple environments as we have dev, qa, uat, and then of course prod.</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/archive/2008/01/22/welcome-to-the-web-deployment-team-blog.aspx" rel="noreferrer">MSDeploy</a> seems really interesting, but unless I'm interpreting the literature incorrectly, doesn't help in the scenario of deploying from the output of a build server. If anything, it seems like it'll be useful in deploying one build across a build farm ... but even for deploying from one environment to another, one would have to manually change config settings and web service URLs, etc.</p>

But since .NET 3.0 there is also WPF available, the Windows Presentation Foundation. It is said that you can make "sexy applications" more easy with it and with .NET 3.5 SP1 it got a good speed boost on execution.</p> <p>But on the other side a lot of things are working different with WPF. I will not say it is more difficult but you have to learn "everything" from scratch.</p> <p>My question: Is it worth to spend this extra time when you have to create a new GUI and there is no time pressure for the project?</p>

58070	0	OOP class design, Is this design inherently 'anti' OOP? <p>I remember back when MS released a forum sample application, the design of the application was like this:</p> <p>/Classes/User.cs /Classes/Post.cs ... /Users.cs /Posts.cs</p> <p>So the classes folder had just the class i.e. properties and getters/setters. The Users.cs, Post.cs, etc. have the actual methods that access the Data Access Layer, so Posts.cs might look like:</p> <pre><code>public class Posts { public static Post GetPostByID(int postID) { SqlDataProvider dp = new SqlDataProvider(); return dp.GetPostByID(postID); } } </code></pre> <p>Another more traditional route would be to put all of the methods in Posts.cs into the class definition also (Post.cs).</p> <p>Splitting things into 2 files makes it much more procedural doesn't it? Isn't this breaking OOP rules since it is taking the behavior out of the class and putting it into another class definition?</p>

4616088	1	Roxygen: how to set a default parameter including backslash ('\') to functions <p>I use Roxygen to generate Rd files of my packages under development, but I have some problems with functions with default parameter set to '<code>\n'</code>, e.g.:</p> <pre><code> lineCount &lt;- function(text, sep='\n') { ... } </code></pre> <p>Which purpose is to count new line (<code>'\n'</code>) characters in a string. The problem is that R CMD check gives a warning about:</p> <pre><code>Codoc mismatches from documentation object 'lineCount': lineCount Code: function(text, sep = "\n") Docs: function(text, sep = " ") Mismatches in argument default values: Name: 'sep' Code: "\n" Docs: " " </code></pre> <p>The problem seems to me that caused by writing to the Rd file (writing to standard LaTeX files via <code>cat()</code> always requires to double escape characters for some purpose, e.g.: <code>\\newline</code> - as I experienced). If I put an extra backslash to the separator, like:</p> <pre><code> lineCount &lt;- function(text, sep='\\n') { ... } </code></pre> <p>The problem still presists, as in the code it looks like <code>'\\n'</code>, but in the docs (Rd files) it looks <code>'\n'</code>.</p> <p>Is there an easy solution for my problem?

4618766	1	Strategy to make pdf() in R use other devices <p>This is a multi-part question to SO folks before I engage more with core team. </p> <p><strong>Summary: On OS X, pdfs should be created using quartz, not postscript. Files are smaller, anti-aliased better, OS fonts including opentype are readily available, encoding is less painful, overall I think it’s a better device. On other platforms, it would be reasonable to use cairo, again a more modern pdf-writing device.</strong></p> <p>Consider the behavior of the png() device. Although it is allegedly slated to move out of x11.R, it handles c("cairo", "Xlib", "quartz") with a default (options("bitmapType")) set by zzz.R (quartz if capabilities("aqua"), cairo if available, Xlib otherwise). PDF needs to behave the same way, so that in Sweave (or babel or whatever) my pdf figures can be generated using the appropriate device. </p> <p>My <a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14418" rel="nofollow">Sweave png patch</a> works because png() takes care of getting the device option. An earlier version of the patch (<a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/attachment.cgi?id=1137&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">which I still use</a>) flips the device in Sweave, but I was smacked down for this and I know it’s sort of the wrong the place to do it.</p> <p><li>There’s some alias cairo_pdf() (also in x11.R) that probably should not be there, shouldn’t that be merged into a device-switching pdf() ?</li> <li>One approach is to add option "pdfType", which in turn I think should probably be more general – there is already a default device, it’s just that pdf() ignores it! I’m especially wary of introducing new global options because they are more likely to be rejected by core.</p>

4624701	1	Prevent coersion to a single type in unlist() or c(); passing arguments to wrapper functions <p>Is there a simple way to flatten a list while retaining the original types of list constituents?.. Is there a way to programmatically construct a flattened list out of different constituent types?..</p> <p>For instance, I want to create a simple wrapper for functions like <code>png(filename,width,height)</code> that would take device name, file name, and a list of options. The naive approach would be something like</p> <pre><code>my.wrapper &lt;- function(dev,name,opts) { do.call(dev,c(filename=name,opts)) } </code></pre> <p>or similar code with <code>unlist(list(...))</code>. This doesn't work because <code>opts</code> gets coerced to character, and the resulting call is e.g. <code>png(filename,width="500",height="500")</code>.</p> <p>If there's no straightforward way to create heterogeneous lists like that, is there a standard idiomatic way to splice arguments into functions without naming them explicitly (e.g. <code>do.call(dev,list(filename=name,width=opts["width"])</code>)?</p> <p>-- Edit --</p> <p>Gavin Simpson answered both questions below in his discussion about constructing wrapper functions. Let me give a summary of the answer to the title question: </p> <p>It is possible to construct a list with <code>c()</code> provided at least one of the arguments to <code>c()</code> is a list. To wit:</p> <pre><code>&gt; foo &lt;- c("a","b"); bar &lt;- 1:3 &gt; c(foo,bar) [1] "a" "b" "1" "2" "3" &gt; typeof(c(foo,bar)) [1] "character" ## note that the result is not a list and that coercion occurred &gt; c(list(foo),list(bar)) ## try also c(foo,list(bar)) [[1]] [1] "a" "b" [[2]] [1] 1 2 3 &gt; typeof(c(foo,list(bar))) [1] "list" ## now the result is a list, so no need to coerce to same type &gt; c(as.list(foo),as.list(bar)) ## this creates a flattened list, as desired [[1]] [1] "a" [[2]] [1] "b" [[3]] [1] 1 [[4]] [1] 2 [[5]] [1] 3 </code></pre>

I’ve found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1504832/help-me-replace-a-for-loop-with-an-apply-function">a somewhat related question</a> here on StackOverflow and even though that gave me some good suggestions, the angle of that question is different, and I’m not (yet) experienced enough to translate and apply that information to this problem. So I was hoping you could help me out, even an suggestion would be great.</p> <p>My data set look like this:</p> <pre><code>&gt; subRes Instrument TradeResult.Currency. 1 JPM -3 2 JPM 264 3 JPM 284 4 JPM 69 5 JPM 283 6 JPM -219 7 JPM -91 8 JPM 165 9 JPM -35 10 JPM -294 11 KFT -8 12 KFT -48 13 KFT 125 14 KFT -150 15 KFT -206 16 KFT 107 17 KFT 107 18 KFT 56 19 KFT -26 20 KFT 189 &gt; split(subRes[,2],subRes[,1]) $JPM [1] -3 264 284 69 283 -219 -91 165 -35 -294 $KFT [1] -8 -48 125 -150 -206 107 107 56 -26 189 </code></pre> <p>In this case, the maximum (winning) streak for JPM is four (namely the 264, 284, 69 and 283 consecutive positive results) and for KFT this value is 3 (107, 107, 56).</p> <p>My <strong>goal</strong> is to create a function which gives the maximum winning streaks per instrument (i.e. JPM: 4, KFT: 3). To achieve that:</p> <p><em>R needs to compare the current result with the previous result, and if it is higher then there is a streak of at least 2 consecutive positive results. Then R needs to look at the next value, and if this is also higher: add 1 to the already found value of 2. If this value isn’t higher, R needs to move on to the next value, while remembering 2 as the intermediate maximum.</em></p> <p>I’ve tried <code>cumsum</code> and <code>cummax</code> in accordance with conditional summing (like <code>cumsum(c(TRUE, diff(subRes[,2]) &gt; 0))</code>), which didn’t work out. Also <code>rle</code> in accordance with <code>lapply</code> (like <code> lapply(rle(subRes$TradeResult.Currency.), function(x) diff(x) &gt; 0)</code>) didn’t work.</p> <p>How can I make this work?</p> <h3>Edit 19 January 2011</h3> <p><strong>Calculating the size of an streak</strong> Besides the length of the streak, I would also like to incorporate the size of the streak in my analysis. With the answers provided below, I thought I was able to do it by myself, sadly I'm mistaken and run into the following problem(s):</p> <p>With the following data frame:</p> <pre><code>&gt; subRes Instrument TradeResult.Currency. 1 JPM -3 2 JPM 264 3 JPM 284 4 JPM 69 5 JPM 283 6 JPM -219 7 JPM -91 8 JPM 165 9 JPM -35 10 JPM -294 11 KFT -8 12 KFT -48 13 KFT 125 14 KFT -150 15 KFT -206 16 KFT 107 17 KFT 107 18 KFT 56 19 KFT -26 20 KFT 189 &gt; lapply(split(subRes[,2], subRes[,1]), function(x) { + df.rle &lt;- ifelse(x &gt; 0, 1, 0) + df.rle &lt;- rle(df.rle) + + wh &lt;- which(df.rle$lengths == max(df.rle$lengths)) + mx &lt;- df.rle$lengths[wh] + suma &lt;- df.rle$lengths[1:wh] + out &lt;- x[(sum(suma) - (suma[length(suma)] - 1)):sum(suma)] + return(out) + }) $JPM [1] 264 284 69 283 $KFT [1] 107 107 56 </code></pre> <p>This result is correct, and changing the last line to <code>return(sum(out))</code> I can get the total size of the streak:</p> <pre><code>$JPM [1] 900 $KFT [1] 270 </code></pre> <p>However, the function does not seem to count the losing streaks when changing the <code>ifelse</code> condition:</p> <pre><code>lapply(split(subRes[,2], subRes[,1]), function(x) { df.rle &lt;- ifelse(x &lt; 0, 1, 0) df.rle &lt;- rle(df.rle) wh &lt;- which(df.rle$lengths == max(df.rle$lengths)) mx &lt;- df.rle$lengths[wh] suma &lt;- df.rle$lengths[1:wh] out &lt;- x[(sum(suma) - (suma[length(suma)] - 1)):sum(suma)] return(out) }) $JPM [1] 264 284 69 283 $KFT [1] 107 107 56 </code></pre> <p>I don’t see what I need to change about this function to ultimately come to the total sum of the losing streak. However I tweak/change the function, I get the same result or an error. The <code>ifelse</code> function confuses me, because it seems the obvious part of the function to change, yet doesn't result in any change. What obvious point am I missing?</p>

Since we are not using Web Controls there are no events being fired from buttons, rather I am manually calling <strong>__doPostBack</strong> with the appropriate arguments. However this can obviously mean that there are a lot of postbacks occuring when say, selecting options (which render differently when selected).</p> <p>In time, I will need to make this more Ajax-y and responsive, so I will need to change the event binding to call local Javascript.</p> <p>So, I was thinking I should be able to toggle the "mode" of the control, it can either use postback and handlle itself, or you can specify the Javascript function names to call instead of the doPostBack.</p> <ul> <li>What are your thoughts on this?</li> <li>Am I approaching the raising of the events from the control in the wrong way?

Here's the query (simplified version) before the fix:</p> <pre><code>select PTNO,PTNM,CATCD from PARTS left join CATEGORIES on (CATEGORIES.CATCD=PARTS.CATCD); </code></pre> <p>and here it is after the fix:</p> <pre><code>select PTNO,PTNM,PARTS.CATCD from PARTS left join CATEGORIES on (CATEGORIES.CATCD=PARTS.CATCD); </code></pre> <p>The bug was, that null values were being shown for column CATCD, i.e. the query results included results from table CATEGORIES instead of PARTS. Here's what I don't understand: if there was ambiguity in the original query, why didn't Oracle throw an error? As far as I understood, in the case of left joins, the "main" table in the query (PARTS) has precedence in ambiguity. Am I wrong, or just not thinking about this problem correctly?</p> <p>Update:</p> <p>Here's a revised example, where the ambiguity error is not thrown:</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE PARTS (PTNO NUMBER, CATCD NUMBER, SECCD NUMBER); CREATE TABLE CATEGORIES(CATCD NUMBER); CREATE TABLE SECTIONS(SECCD NUMBER, CATCD NUMBER); select PTNO,CATCD from PARTS left join CATEGORIES on (CATEGORIES.CATCD=PARTS.CATCD) left join SECTIONS on (SECTIONS.SECCD=PARTS.SECCD) ; </code></pre> <p>Anybody have a clue?</p>

59098	0	Does Windows Server 2003 SP2 tell the truth about Free System Page Table Entries? <p>We have some Win32 console applications running on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 that regularly fail with this:</p> <blockquote> <p>Error 1450 (<code>ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES</code>): "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service."</p> </blockquote> <p>All the documentation we've found suggests it is linked to the number of <strong>Free System Page Table Entries</strong> running out. We have 16GB RAM in these machines and use the <code>/3GB</code> Operating System switch to squeeze the Windows kernel into 1GB and allow our processes access to 3GB of address space. This drastically reduces the total number of Free System Page Table Entries, so combined with our heavy use of MapViewOfFile() it is perhaps not surprising that the kernel page table entries are running out.</p> <p>However, when using Performance Monitor to view the Free System Page Table Entries counter, the value is around 36,000 on reboot and <strong>doesn't go down when our application starts</strong>. I find it hard to believe that our application, which opens many large memory-mapped files, doesn't have any effect on the kernel page table. If we can't believe the counter, it's much more difficult to test the effect of any system changes we make.</p> <p>There is a promising Knowledge Base article, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/894067" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Performance tool does not accurately show the available Free System Page Table entries in Windows Server 2003</a>, but it says the problem has been fixed in Service Pack 1, and we are already on Service Pack 2.</p> <p>Has anyone else struggled with or solved this issue?</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I have checked !sysptes in windbg (debugging the kernel) and the value matches the performance counter, around 36,000. I guess this is most likely to mean that there really are that many free page table entries and Windows <em>is</em> telling the truth. It does leave the question of why we're getting 1450 errors though, if the PTEs are not running out.</p> <p><strong>Further update:</strong> We never did get to the bottom of why the 1450 errors were occurring. <em>However</em>, instead we upgraded the OS on these servers to 64-bit Windows. This allows the existing 32-bit applications (without recompilation) to access a full 4GB of virtual address space, and lets the kernel memory area with those pesky Page Table Entries be as big as it likes too. I don't think we've had a 1450 error since.</p>

4682709	1	How to write an R function that evaluates an expression within a data-frame <p>Puzzle for the R cognoscenti: Say we have a data-frame:</p> <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 ) </code></pre> <p>I know we can do things like</p> <pre><code>with(df, a) </code></pre> <p>to get a vector of results. </p> <p>But how do I write a function that takes an expression (such as <code>a</code> or <code>a &gt; 3</code>) and does the same thing inside. I.e. I want to write a function <code>fn</code> that takes a data-frame and an expression as arguments and returns the result of evaluating the expression "within" the data-frame as an environment. </p> <p>Never mind that this sounds contrived (I could just use <code>with</code> as above), but this is just a simplified version of a more complex function I am writing. I tried several variants ( using <code>eval</code>, <code>with</code>, <code>envir</code>, <code>substitute</code>, <code>local</code>, etc) but none of them work. For example if I define <code>fn</code> like so:</p> <pre><code>fn &lt;- function(dat, expr) { eval(expr, envir = dat) } </code></pre> <p>I get this error:</p> <pre><code>&gt; fn( df, a ) Error in eval(expr, envir = dat) : object 'a' not found </code></pre> <p>Clearly I am missing something subtle about environments and evaluation.

Let's say I want to write a function <code>topfn</code> that takes a data-frame and an expression involving column-names of that data-frame. I want to pass both these arguments on to another function <code>fn</code> that actually evaluates the expression within the "environment" of the data-frame. <em>And I want both <code>fn</code> and <code>topfn</code> to work correctly when passed a data-frame and an expression</em></p> <p>My first attempt, as suggested in the answer to the above question, is to define:</p> <pre><code> fn &lt;- function(dfr, expr) { mf &lt;- match.call() eval( mf$expr, envir = dfr ) } </code></pre> <p>And define <code>topfn</code> like this:</p> <pre><code>topfn &lt;- function(df, ex) { mf &lt;- match.call() fn(df, mf$ex) } </code></pre> <p>Now if I have a data-frame</p> <pre><code>df &lt;- data.frame( a = 1:5, b = 1:5 ) </code></pre> <p>the inner function <code>fn</code> works fine: </p> <pre><code>&gt; fn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre> <p>But the <code>topfn</code> does not work: </p> <pre><code>&gt; topfn(df,a) mf$ex </code></pre> <p>To fix this I first check the class of <code>topfn(df,a)</code>, </p> <pre><code>&gt; class(topfn(df,a)) [1] "call" </code></pre> <p>This gives me an idea for an ugly hack to re-define <code>fn</code> as follows:</p> <pre><code>fn &lt;- function(dfr, expr) { mf &lt;- match.call() res &lt;- eval(mf$expr, envir = dfr) if(class(res) == 'call') eval(expr, envir = dfr) else res } </code></pre> <p>And now both functions work:</p> <pre><code>&gt; fn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 &gt; topfn(df,a) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 </code></pre> <p>As I said, this looks like an ugly hack. Is there a better way (or more standard idiom) to get these working?

59622	0	Detecting application hangs with ActiveX controls in .Net <p>I am working on upgrades to a screen scraping application. We are using an ActiveX control to scrape screens out of an IBM mainframe. The mainframe program often hangs and crashes the ActiveX control causing our application to crash. We don't have access to the mainframe or the ActiveX source code. We are not going to write our own active x control.</p> <p>What is the bast way to encapsulate an ActiveX control to detect application hangs with the control so we can kill the process and restart with code?</p> <p>Should I create 2 separate applications? One as a controller that checks on the other and kills/restarts the process when it hangs? </p> <p>Would they have to be on separate app domains? Is it possible have two programs communicate with each other even if they are on separate app domains?</p>

If yes, how would you define them?</p> <p>EDIT: Deadlock is another problem, but data inconsistency might be worse, depending on the application domain. Assuming a transaction-worthy domain (banking, to use the canonical example), deadlock possibility is more like a cost to pay for ensuring data consistency, rather than a problem with transactions use, or you would disagree? If so, what other solutions would you use to ensure data consistency which are deadlock free? </p>

4750866	1	Aggregate() example in R <p>I was looking at the help page for the <code>aggregate</code> function in R. I had never used this convenience function but I have a process it should help me speed up. However, I've been totally unable to walk through the example and understand what is going on. </p> <p>One example is the following:</p> <pre><code>1&gt; aggregate(state.x77, list(Region = state.region), mean) Region Population Income Illiteracy Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost Area 1 Northeast 5495 4570 1.000 71.26 4.722 53.97 132.78 18141 2 South 4208 4012 1.738 69.71 10.581 44.34 64.62 54605 3 North Central 4803 4611 0.700 71.77 5.275 54.52 138.83 62652 4 West 2915 4703 1.023 71.23 7.215 62.00 102.15 134463 </code></pre> <p>The output here is exactly what I would expect. So I try to understand what is going on. So I look at <code>state.x77</code></p> <pre><code>1&gt; head(state.x77) Population Income Illiteracy Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost Area Alabama 3615 3624 2.1 69.05 15.1 41.3 20 50708 Alaska 365 6315 1.5 69.31 11.3 66.7 152 566432 Arizona 2212 4530 1.8 70.55 7.8 58.1 15 113417 Arkansas 2110 3378 1.9 70.66 10.1 39.9 65 51945 California 21198 5114 1.1 71.71 10.3 62.6 20 156361 Colorado 2541 4884 0.7 72.06 6.8 63.9 166 103766 </code></pre> <p>OK, that's odd to me. I would expect to see a column in state.x77 named <code>state.region</code> or something. So state.region must be its own object. So I do a str() on it:</p> <pre><code>1&gt; str(state.region) Factor w/ 4 levels "Northeast","South",..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ... </code></pre> <p>It looks like state.region is just a factor. Somehow there HAS to be a connection between state.region and state.x77 in order for aggregate() to group state.x77 by state.region. But that connection is a mystery to me. Can you help me fill in my obvious misunderstandings?</p>

60950	0	Is there a better Windows Console Window? <p>I find working on the command line in Windows frustrating, primarily because the console window is wretched to use compared to terminal applications on linux and OS X such as "rxvt", "xterm", or "Terminal". Major complaints:</p> <ol> <li><p>No standard copy/paste. You have to turn on "mark" mode and it's only available from a multi-level popup triggered by the (small) left hand corner button. Then copy and paste need to be invoked from the same menu</p></li> <li><p>You can't arbitrarily resize the window by dragging, you need to set a preference (back to the multi-level popup) each time you want to resize a window</p></li> <li><p>You can only make the window so big before horizontal scroll bars enter the picture. Horizontal scroll bars suck.</p></li> <li><p>With the cmd.exe shell, you can't navigate to folders with \\netpath notation (UNC?), you need to map a network drive. This sucks when working on multiple machines that are going to have different drives mapped</p></li> </ol> <p>Are there any tricks or applications, (paid or otherwise), that address these issue?</p>

I mean with the idea of facilitating builds, deploys release, and etc.</p> <p>I recently used a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Maven structure</a> for a java project, but I am not sure it's the best structure for a non-maven driven project.</p> <p>So, I have two questions: When you guys start new projects, what structure you use? And: What if you need to integrate two different languages, like for example java classes into a PHP application; PHP files are source files, web files, you you use a /src, /classes, webapps/php ? What are your choices in such scenarios. </p> <p>As a note: I am wondering also what are you choices for directories names. I like the 3-letters names (src, lib, bin, web, img, css, xml, cfg) but what are your opinions about descriptive names like libraris, sources or htdocs/public_html ?</p>

4774781	1	using R's internal tar function on specific files <p>R has a handy cross platform tar() function that can tar and gzip files. It seems this function was designed to tar up entire directories. I was hoping to use this function to tar and compress a subset of a directory, or a single file. I can't seem to do this, however. I was expecting the following to tar up a single csv file in the current working directory:</p> <pre><code>tar( "tst.tgz", "myCsv.csv", compression="gzip" ) </code></pre> <p>So is it only possible to use the tar() function on directories?</p> <p>I've temporarily gotten around this by creating a temp directory, copying my files, and then tarring the whole temp dir. But I was hoping for a bit simpler solution. That would not require copying the files which is somewhat time consuming for large files. </p>
61073	0	How can I make my VS2008 x86 installer install x64 assemblies on x64? <p>I'm using the VS2008 installer (plus a custom Orca action) to create an installer for my .NET product.</p> <p>I just recently found out that one of the third-party assemblies I was using is x86-specific (as it includes some native code); thus, x64 customers were getting crashes on startup with errors about the assembly not being appropriate for their platform.</p> <p>I sent such a customer a copy of the x64 version of this third-party assembly, and told him to just copy it over the existing x86 one. It worked, sweet! So now I just need to make the installer do this for me.</p> <p>This actually appears nontrivial :(. Ideally, I just want the installer (which would be x86, since that can run on both platforms) to include both the x86 and x64 versions of this third-party assembly, and install the appropriate one. In other words, I want a single installer that makes my users' lives easy.</p> <p>I thought I had this worked out, using MSI conditional statements and all that. But apparently no... the VS2008 setup projects won't compile unless you specify "x86" or "x64." If you specify x86, it gives a compilation error saying it can't include the x64 assembly. If you specify x64, then the result cannot be executed on an x86 computer. Damn!</p> <p>Someone must have had this problem before. Unfortunately Google is unhelpful, so I turn to StackOverflow!</p>

I can read from the database fine, but none of my updates are being committed to the database when I view the page in the browser. Curiously, running the script from my shell does update the database. I suspected file permissions as the culprit, but even with the database providing full access (chmod 777) the problem persists. Should I try changing the file owner? If so, what to?</p> <p>By the way, my machine is the standard Mac OS X Leopard install with PHP activated.</p> <p>@Tom Martin</p> <p>Thank you for your reply. I just ran your code and it looks like PHP runs as user _www. I then tried chowning the database to be owned by _www, but that didn't work either.</p> <p>I should also note that PDO's errorInfo function doesn't indicate an error took place. Could this be a setting with PDO somehow opening the database for read-only? I've heard that SQLite performs write locks on the entire file.

61219	0	Debug.Assert vs. Specific Thrown Exceptions <p>I've just started skimming 'Debugging MS .Net 2.0 Applications' by John Robbins, and have become confused by his evangelism for Debug.Assert(...).</p> <p>He points out that well-implemented Asserts store the state, somewhat, of an error condition, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, "i &gt; 3", "This means I got a bad parameter"); </code></pre> <p>Now, personally, it seems crazy to me that he so loves restating his test without an actual sensible 'business logic' comment, perhaps "i &lt;= 3 must never happen because of the flobittyjam widgitification process".</p> <p>So, I think I get Asserts as a kind-of low-level "Let's protect my assumptions" kind of thing... assuming that one feels this is a test one only needs to do in debug - i.e. you are protecting yourself against colleague and future programmers, and hoping that they actually test things.</p> <p>But what I don't get is, he then goes on to say that you should use assertions in addition to normal error handling; now what I envisage is something like this:</p> <pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, "i must be greater than 3 because of the flibbity widgit status"); if (i &lt;= 3) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("i", "i must be &gt; 3 because... i=" + i.ToString()); } </code></pre> <p>What have I gained by the Debug.Assert repetition of the error condition test? I think I'd get it if we were talking about debug-only double-checking of a very important calculation...</p> <pre><code>double interestAmount = loan.GetInterest(); Debug.Assert(debugInterestDoubleCheck(loan) == interestAmount, "Mismatch on interest calc"); </code></pre> <p>...but I don't get it for parameter tests which are surely worth checking (in both DEBUG and Release builds)... or not.

61354	0	How to get entire chain of Exceptions in Application.ThreadException event handler? <p>I was just working on fixing up exception handling in a .NET 2.0 app, and I stumbled onto some weird issue with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.threadexception.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Application.ThreadException</a>.</p> <p>What I want is to be able to catch all exceptions from events behind GUI elements (e.g. button_Click, etc.). I then want to filter these exceptions on 'fatality', e.g. with some types of Exceptions the application should keep running and with others it should exit.</p> <p>In another .NET 2.0 app I learned that, by default, only in debug mode the exceptions actually leave an Application.Run or Application.DoEvents call. In release mode this does not happen, and the exceptions have to be 'caught' using the Application.ThreadException event.</p> <p>Now, however, I noticed that <strong>the exception object passed in the ThreadExceptionEventArgs of the Application.ThreadException event is always the innermost exception in the exception chain</strong>. For logging/debugging/design purposes I really want the entire chain of exceptions though. It isn't easy to determine what external system failed for example when you just get to handle a SocketException: when it's wrapped as e.g. a NpgsqlException, then at least you know it's a database problem.</p> <p><strong>So, how to get to the entire chain of exceptions from this event?</strong> Is it even possible or do I need to design my excepion handling in another way?</p> <p>Note that I do -sort of- have a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61366/rolling-your-own-message-loop-any-pitfalls">workaround</a> using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.setunhandledexceptionmode.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Application.SetUnhandledExceptionMode</a>, but this is far from ideal because I'd have to roll my own message loop.</p> <p>EDIT: to prevent more mistakes, <strong>the GetBaseException() method does NOT do what I want</strong>: it just returns the innermost exception, while the only thing I already have is the innermost exception. I want to get at the outermost exception!</p>

61401	0	Hidden Features of PHP? <p>I know this sounds like a point-whoring question but let me explain where I'm coming from.</p> <p>Out of college I got a job at a PHP shop. I worked there for a year and a half and thought that I had learned all there was to learn about programming.</p> <p>Then I got a job as a one-man internal development shop at a sizable corporation where all the work was in C#. In my commitment to the position I started reading a ton of blogs and books and quickly realized how wrong I was to think I knew everything. I learned about unit testing, dependency injection and decorator patterns, the design principle of loose coupling, the composition over inheritance debate, and so on and on and on - I am still very much absorbing it all. Needless to say my programming style has changed entirely in the last year.</p> <p>Now I find myself picking up a php project doing some coding for a friend's start-up and I feel completely constrained as opposed to programming in C#. It really bothers me that all variables at a class scope have to be referred to by appending '$this->' . It annoys me that none of the IDEs that I've tried have very good intellisense and that my SimpleTest unit tests methods have to start with the word 'test'. It drives me crazy that dynamic typing keeps me from specifying implicitly which parameter type a method expects, and that you have to write a switch statement to do method overloads. I can't stand that you can't have nested namespaces and have to use the :: operator to call the base class's constructor.</p> <p>Now I have no intention of starting a PHP vs C# debate, rather what I mean to say is that I'm sure there are some PHP features that I either don't know about or know about yet fail to use properly. I am set in my C# universe and having trouble seeing outside the glass bowl.</p> <p>So I'm asking, what are your favorite features of PHP? What are things you can do in it that you can't or are more difficult in the .Net languages?</p>

61421	0	How do I make a ListBox refresh its item text? <p>I'm making an example for someone who hasn't yet realized that controls like <code>ListBox</code> don't have to contain strings; he had been storing formatted strings and jumping through complicated parsing hoops to get the data back out of the <code>ListBox</code> and I'd like to show him there's a better way.</p> <p>I noticed that if I have an object stored in the <code>ListBox</code> then update a value that affects <code>ToString</code>, the <code>ListBox</code> does not update itself. I've tried calling <code>Refresh</code> and <code>Update</code> on the control, but neither works. Here's the code of the example I'm using, it requires you to drag a listbox and a button onto the form:</p> <pre><code>Public Class Form1 Protected Overrides Sub OnLoad(ByVal e As System.EventArgs) MyBase.OnLoad(e) For i As Integer = 1 To 3 Dim tempInfo As New NumberInfo() tempInfo.Count = i tempInfo.Number = i * 100 ListBox1.Items.Add(tempInfo) Next End Sub Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click For Each objItem As Object In ListBox1.Items Dim info As NumberInfo = DirectCast(objItem, NumberInfo) info.Count += 1 Next End Sub End Class Public Class NumberInfo Public Count As Integer Public Number As Integer Public Overrides Function ToString() As String Return String.Format("{0}, {1}", Count, Number) End Function End Class</code></pre> <p>I thought that perhaps the problem was using fields and tried implementing <em>INotifyPropertyChanged</em>, but this had no effect. (The reason I'm using fields is because it's an example and I don't feel like adding a few dozen lines that have nothing to do with the topic I'm demonstrating.)</p> <p>Honestly I've never tried updating items in place like this before; in the past I've always been adding/removing items, not editing them. So I've never noticed that I don't know how to make this work.</p> <p>So what am I missing?</p>

I am trying to include it here so that the user does not need to edit the R script in order to specify the location of that file.</p> <p>My Windows command line syntax is:</p> <pre><code>R CMD BATCH --slave "--args fn=batch.csv" myscript.r output.txt </code></pre> <p>The closest I have gotten to retrieving this in my R script is by doing:</p> <pre><code>eval(parse(file=commandArgs()[8]))) batch_args = read.table(fn, sep=",") </code></pre> <p>I have experimented with <code>commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)</code> and <code>parse(text=commandArgs()[8])</code>, etc., with no luck. Most of the documentation that I have seen does not apply specifically to passing filenames. Can anyone think of a solution?</p>

I believe I have to use a <code>position="fill"</code> somewhere, but I'm not sure where to put it. Basically, what I am trying to show is that Demand will be steadily rising, while Supply (Actual vs. projected Low growth vs. projected High growth) has been unable to meet it in a very simple, compact graphic. If this is not possible, perhaps it would be better to simply group them side-by-side?</p> <p>Any help is much appreciated!! Thanks!!</p>
4811995	1	Comparing R to Matlab for Data Mining <p>Instead of starting to code in Matlab, I recently started learning R, mainly because it is open-source. I am currently working in data mining and machine learning field. I found many machine learning algorithms implemented in R, and I am still exploring different packages implemented in R.</p> <p>I have quick question: how do you compare R to Matlab for data mining application, its popularity, pros and cons, industry and academic acceptance etc.? Which one would you choose and why?</p> <p>I went through various comparisons for Matlab vs R against various metrics but I am specifically interested to get answer for its applicability in Data Mining and ML. Since both language are pretty new for me I was just wondering if R would be a good choice or not.</p> <p>I appreciate any kind of suggestions.</p>

61805	0	ASP.NET MVC ViewData (using indices) <p>I had a working solution using ASP.NET MVC Preview 3 (was upgraded from a Preview 2 solution) that uses an untyped ViewMasterPage like so:</p> <pre><code>public partial class Home : ViewMasterPage </code></pre> <p>On Home.Master there is a display statement like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;%= ((GenericViewData)ViewData["Generic"]).Skin %&gt; </code></pre> <p>However, a developer on the team just changed the assembly references to Preview 4.</p> <p>Following this, the code will no longer populate ViewData with indexed values like the above.</p> <p>Instead, ViewData["Generic"] is null.</p> <p>As per <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18787/aspnet-mvc-user-control-viewdata">this question</a>, ViewData.Eval("Generic") works, and ViewData.Model is also populated correctly.</p> <p>However, the reason this solution isn't using typed pages etc. is because it is kind of a legacy solution. As such, it is impractical to go through this fairly large solution and update all .aspx pages (especially as the compiler doesn't detect this sort of stuff).</p> <p>I have tried reverting the assemblies by removing the reference and then adding a reference to the Preview 3 assembly in the 'bin' folder of the project. This did not change anything. I have even tried reverting the Project file to an earlier version and that still did not seem to fix the problem.</p> <p>I have other solutions using the same technique that continue to work.</p> <p>Is there anything you can suggest as to why this has suddenly stopped working and how I might go about fixing it (any hint in the right direction would be appreciated)?</p>

61850	0	Is there a way to asynchronously filter an IList? <p>Ok, so there has to be a way to do this... no? If not I'd love some ideas. </p> <p>I have two repeaters and an image inside an update panel along with some AJAX dropdowns with link buttons to the left. I want to update the data inside the update panel as fast as possible as values are selected from the dropdowns. </p> <p>What do you think would be the best way to update the data? The repeaters are populated by objects, so if I could just filter the objects by some properties I could end up with the correct data. No new data from the server is needed. </p> <p>Anyone have some ideas?</p>
