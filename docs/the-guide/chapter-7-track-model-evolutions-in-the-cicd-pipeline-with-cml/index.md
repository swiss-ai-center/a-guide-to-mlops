# Chapter 7: Track model evolutions in the CI/CD pipeline with CML

## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to track the evolutions of the model and to
generate reports directly from the CI/CD pipeline. This will enable
collaborators to discuss changes online before merging changes in the codebase.

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

1. Update the CI/CD configuration file to generate a CML report
2. Push the updated CI/CD configuration file to Git
3. Open an issue in your issue tracker
4. Create a new branch to add your changes
5. Check out the new branch
6. Commit and push the changes that were not committed in [Chapter 5: Track
   model evolutions with
   DVC](../chapter-5-track-model-evolutions-with-dvc)
7. Create a pull request/merge request
8. Visualize the execution of the CI/CD pipeline
9. Visualize the CML report that is added to your pull request/merge request
10. Merge the pull request/merge request to the main branch
11. Switch back to the main branch and pull latest changes

!!! info

	CML can do much more than just generating reports.
	Have a look to the [Train the model on a Kubernetes cluster with
	CML](../../advanced-concepts/train-the-model-on-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cml) guide.

## Steps

The reports generated by CML compare the current run with a target reference.

The target reference can be a specific commit (what are the differences between
the current run and the run from the target commit) or a branch (what are the
differences between the current run and the run from the target branch).

Many workflows enable teams to discuss and integrate the work done to a target
reference. For the sake of simplicity, in this guide, we will present two
methods that are commonly used on GitHub - pull requests (PRs) - and GitLab -
merge requests (MRs) - to integrate the work done into the `main` branch.

### Update the CI/CD pipeline configuration file

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	Update the `.github/workflows/mlops.yml` file.

	Take some time to understand the report job and its steps.

	You may notice that the `report` job doesn't use Poetry. As we do not need to reproduce the experiment, we can install DVC using the `iterative/setup-dvc@v1` GitHub action without Poetry. DVC will then retrieve the data stored on the bucket on its own.

	The new `report` job is responsible for reporting the results of the model
	evaluation and comparing it with the main branch. This job is triggered only
	when a pull request is opened and commits are made to it. The job checks out the
	repository, sets up DVC and CML, creates and publishes the report as a pull request comment.

	Take some time to understand the changes made to the file.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	In order to allow CML to generate reports, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be
	created. A Project or a Group Access Token are not sufficient for the usage of
	CML's runners that will be used in the next steps.

	To create a Personal Access Token, go in your **Profile preferences > Access
	Tokens**.

	- **Token name**: _CML_
	- **Expiration date**: _None_
	- **Select scopes**: `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository`

	Select **Create personal access token** to create the token. Copy it. It will be
	displayed only once.

	Store the PAT as a CI/CD Variable by going to **Settings > CI/CD** from the left
	sidebar of your GitLab project.

	Select **Variables** and select **Add variable**.

	Create a new variable named `CML_PAT` with the PAT value as its value.

	- **Protect variable**: _Unchecked_
	- **Mask variable**: _Checked_
	- **Expand variable reference**: _Unchecked_

	Save the variable by clicking **Add variable**.

	Update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

	Explore this file to understand the report stage and its steps.

	The new `report` job is responsible for reporting the results of the model
	evaluation and comparing it with the main branch. This job is triggered only
	when a merge request is opened and commits are made to it. The job checks out
	the repository, sets up DVC and CML, creates and publishes the report
	as a merge request comment.

	Take some time to understand the changes made to the file.

### Push the CI/CD pipeline configuration file to Git

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
	# Add the updated workflow
	git add .github/workflows/mlops.yml

	# Commit the changes
	git commit -m "Enable CML reports on pull requests"

	# Push the changes
	git push
	```

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
	# Add the updated GitLab CI
	git add .gitlab-ci.yml
	
	# Commit the changes
	git commit -m "Enable CML reports on merge requests"
	
	# Push the changes
	git push
	```

### Open an issue

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	Create a new issue by going to the **Issues** section from the top header of
	your GitHub repository. Select **New issue** and describe the
	work/improvements/ideas that you want to integrate to the codebase. In this
	guide, we will name the issue _Demonstrate chapter 7_. Create the issue by
	selecting **Submit new issue**.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	Create a new issue by going to the **Issues** section from the left sidebar of
	your GitLab project. Select **New issue** and describe the
	work/improvements/ideas that you want to integrate to the codebase. In this
	guide, we will name the issue _Demonstrate chapter 7_. Create the issue by
	selecting **Submit new issue**.

### Create a branch for the issue

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	In the newly created issue, select **Create a branch for this issue or link a
	pull request** from the right sidebar. Create the branch by selecting **Create
	branch**. A new pop-up opens with the name of the branch you want to checkout
	to.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	In the newly created issue, select **Create merge request** and change the merge request configuration if
	needed. Create the merge request by selecting **Create merge request**. This will automatically create a
	new branch linked to the issue.

### Checkout the new branch

On your machine, check out the new branch.

```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
# Get the latest updates from the remote origin
git fetch origin

# Check to the new branch
git checkout <the name of the new branch>
```

### Commit and push the experiment changes

Remember the changes done in [Chapter 5: Track model evolutions with
DVC](../chapter-5-track-model-evolutions-with-dvc)?

You can now commit them to trigger a change on the remote repository.

If you don't have changes in your working directory, just update the parameters
of the experiment in `params.yaml` and reproduce the experiment with `dvc
repro`. You can then commit the changes.

Check the changes with Git to ensure all wanted files are here.

```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
# Add all the files
git add .

# Check the status
git status
```

The output of the `git status` command should be similar to this.

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   .gitignore
	modified:   dvc.lock
	modified:   params.yaml
```

```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
# Upload the experiment data and cache to the remote bucket
dvc push

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "I made some changes to the model"

# Push the changes
git push
```

### Create a pull request/merge request

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	Go back to your GitHub repository. A new **Compare & pull request** button
	should automatically appear. Click on it. Name the pull request and select
	**Create pull request**.

	!!! info

		You might need to wait for the pipeline to finish before the button appears.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	The merge request has already been created from the issue earlier, you can
	proceed to the next step.

### Visualize the execution of the CI/CD pipeline

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	The pull request opens and automatically starts the workflow `MLOps / train
	(pull_request)` under the **Some checks haven’t completed yet** section. You can
	click on **Details** to see the execution details.
	
	Explore the output and try to identify the steps that are executed.
	
	Once the workflow is done, a new workflow `MLOps / report (pull_request)` is
	started under the **Some checks haven’t completed yet** section. You can click
	on **Details** to see the details.
	
	Explore the output and try to see how the configuration file shows up in GitHub.
	
	Once all workflows have successfully been executed, the **Some checks haven't
	completed yet** section should become **All checks have passed**.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	Open the merge request. The pipeline should start. Click on the pipeline number
	to see its details.
	
	Explore the stages and jobs and try to see how the configuration file shows up
	in GitLab.

### Visualize the CML report

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	When the CI/CD pipeline completes, a new comment is added to your pull request.
	Check the pull request and examine the report published by CML. As it uses the
	evaluation data that was pulled from DVC, it can uses it to display all the
	plots.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	When the CI/CD pipeline completes, a new comment is added to your merge request.
	Check the merge request and examine the report made by CML. As it uses the
	evaluation data that was pulled DVC, it can uses it to display all the
	plots.

### Merge the pull request/merge request

=== ":simple-github: GitHub"

	Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can merge the changes.
	
	Go back to the pull request. At the end of the page, select **Merge pull
	request**. Confirm the merge by selecting **Confirm merge**.
	
	The associated issue will be automatically closed as well.
	
	You can delete the branch by clicking **Delete branch** to clean up your
	repository. If you ever need to go back to this branch, you can always restore
	the branch from this menu.
	
	Congrats! You can now iterate on your model while keeping a trace of the
	improvements made to it. You can visualize and discuss the changes made to a
	model before merging them into the codebase.

=== ":simple-gitlab: GitLab"

	Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can merge the changes.
	
	Go back to the merge request. Select **Mark as ready**. This will allow to merge
	the changes. Confirm the merge by selecting **Merge** (you might need to refresh
	the page to see this button).
	
	The associated issue will be automatically closed as well.
	
	Congrats! You can now iterate on your model while keeping a trace of the
	improvements made to it. You can visualize and discuss the changes made to a
	model before merging them into the codebase.

### Switch back to the main branch and pull latest changes

Now that the merge is done, you can get the changes on the main branch.

```sh title="Execute the following command(s) in a terminal"
# Get the latest updates from the remote origin
git fetch origin

# Check to the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the changes made by the pull request/merge request
git pull
```

This chapter is done, you can check the summary.

## Summary

In this chapter, you have successfully:

1. Updated the CI/CD configuration file to generate a CML report
2. Pushed the updated CI/CD configuration file to Git
3. Opened an issue in your issue tracker
4. Created a new branch to add your changes
5. Checked out the new branch
6. Commit and pushed the changes that were not committed in [Chapter 5: Track
   model evolutions with
   DVC](../chapter-5-track-model-evolutions-with-dvc)
7. Created a pull request/merge request
8. Visualized the execution of the CI/CD pipeline
9. Visualized the CML report that is added to your pull request/merge request
10. Merged the pull request/merge request to the main branch
11. Switched back to the main branch and pulled latest changes

However, you might have identified the following areas for improvement:

- ❌ How can I serve my model to the rest of the world?

In the next chapters, you will enhance the workflow to fix those issues.

You can now safely continue to the next chapter.

## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared and improved by multiple developers
- ✅ The dataset can be shared among the developers and is placed in the right
  directory in order to run the experiment
- ✅ The steps used to create the model are documented and can be re-executed
- ✅ The changes done to a model can be visualized with parameters, metrics and
  plots to identify differences between iterations
- ✅ The experiment can be executed on a clean machine with the help of a CI/CD
  pipeline and CML
- ❌ Model may have required artifacts that are forgotten or omitted in
  saved/loaded state and there is no easy way to use the model outside of the
  experiment context
