# Introduction

## Welcome

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! We are glad that you are here. 

This guide will help you take your ML projects from experiment to production
with ease. In this half-day MLOps workshop, gain hands-on experience with Git
for code versioning, DVC for data versioning, CML for performance tracking, and
MLEM for deployment. We hope that this guide will help you streamline your
workflows, ensure reproducibility, and move your models from the lab to the
real-world with confidence.

## Environment

This guide has been written with macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If
you use Windows, you might encounter issues. Please use
