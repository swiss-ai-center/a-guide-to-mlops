# DVC & Git: Data and code cannot evolve independently

## Observations

As DVC is used on top of Git, when the data is updated, the metadata files linked with Git must be updated as well.

## Implications

It is not possible to make the data evolves using another tool without updating the Git metadata files.

## Ideas considered

_None at the moment_
