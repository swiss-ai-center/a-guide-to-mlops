!!! note

    If you want to pursue the next part of the guide, you can skip this section and
    continue with the next part.

If you decide to conclude your progress with the guide at this point, we
recommend visiting the [Clean up](../clean-up.md) section to ensure the proper
removal of the resources and environments you have generated.

This is necessary in order to return to a clean state on your computer, avoid
unnecessary incurring costs and potential security concerns when using cloud
services.
