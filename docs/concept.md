Introduction to MLOps.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps (short for _"Machine Learning Operations"_) is a set of practices for
deploying, managing, and monitoring machine learning models in production.

Similar to DevOps, MLOps combines software development practices with data
science to automate the ML lifecycle: data preparation, model training,
deployment, and maintenance. The goal is to build models that are accurate,
scalable, and secure.

Building effective ML systems requires more than just perfecting the model
itself. In fact, the ML code and model make up only a small fraction of a
real-world ML system. The surrounding infrastructure needed for deployment and
operation is much larger and more complex.

MLOps uses tools like version control, continuous integration and deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines, containers, and monitoring systems to manage this complexity.
This helps teams deploy models faster with fewer errors and less downtime.

## What problems does MLOps aim to solve?

MLOps addresses common challenges in deploying machine learning models to
production:

- **Scalability**: Managing resources to handle large datasets and growing
  demands efficiently.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring models can be replicated consistently across
  different environments with the same training data and configuration.
- **Data management**: Maintaining clean, properly labeled, high-quality data
  throughout the ML lifecycle.
- **Model drift**: Detecting when model performance degrades over time due to
  changing data patterns and making timely adjustments.
- **Security**: Protecting models and data from vulnerabilities and ensuring
  privacy and integrity.

By addressing these challenges, MLOps helps teams deploy models faster while
maintaining quality and reliability in production.

## Why would MLOps be useful for you?

MLOps provides key benefits for anyone developing or deploying machine learning
models:

- **Efficiency**: Automate repetitive tasks like data preparation, training, and
  deployment to save time and reduce errors.
- **Accuracy**: Train models on high-quality data with optimized configurations
  for better performance in production.
- **Scalability**: Handle larger datasets and growing workloads as your needs
  expand.
- **Speed**: Deploy models faster and get them to production quickly.
- **Collaboration**: Improve communication and alignment between data
  scientists, developers, and operations teams.

MLOps makes it easier to build and deploy machine learning models that are
reliable, maintainable, and ready for production use.
