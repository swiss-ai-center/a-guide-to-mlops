# Chapter 1 - Run a simple ML experiment with Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

You have just joined a new ML team whose goal is to build a model that can
classify text into two categories: "related to R programming language" and "not
related to R programming language".

Their dataset consists of 10,000 posts from StackOverflow.

Your goal is to streamline the team's workflow by setting up MLOps tools,
documenting the process, tracking changes, and making the model accessible to
others.


In this chapter, you will learn how to:

1. Set up the project directory
2. Acquire the codebase
3. Obtain the dataset
4. Create a Python environment to run the experiment
5. Launch the experiment locally for the first time

Let's get started!

## Steps

### Explore the notebook

The training process is as follows:

- Mark the R-related posts posts as `1` and the others as `0`
- Split the posts into training/testing datasets
- Create bag-of-words matrices from the post titles and descriptions
- Train a model to classify R vs. non-R posts using the training dataset
- Evaluate the model's performance using a precision-recall (PR) curve and a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve



### Run the experiment

Run the notebook.

### Check the results

Visualize the notebook results.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully reproduced the experiment on your machine.

In this chapter, you have:

1. Created the working directory
2. Acquired the codebase
3. Obtained the dataset
4. Set up a Python environment to run the experiment
5. Executed the experiment locally for the first time

However, you may have identified the following areas for improvement:

- ❌ Codebase still needs manual download
- ❌ Dataset still needs manual download and placement
- ❌ Steps to run the experiment were not documented

In the next chapters, you will enhance the workflow to fix those issues.

You can now safely continue to the next chapter.
