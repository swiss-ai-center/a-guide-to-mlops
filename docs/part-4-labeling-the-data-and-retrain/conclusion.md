# Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the fourth part of the guide.
In this part, you learned how to annotate the data using Label Studio using
assisted labeling. You finally retrained the model using the newly labeled data.

This concludes the guide. We hope you enjoyed it and learned a lot. If you have
any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us on
[GitHub](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/a-guide-to-mlops).

The final part of the guide will cover cleaning up the resources and
environments you have generated. We strongly recommend to go through the
[Clean up](../clean-up.md) section to ensure the proper removal of the resources
and environments you have generated.
