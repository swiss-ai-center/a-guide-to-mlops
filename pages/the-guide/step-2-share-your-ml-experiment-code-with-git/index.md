## Introduction

Now that we have a running ML experiment , it's time to add some MLOps to it.

Our first improvement will only concern the experiment code and will ensure it is versioned and can be shared with the team.

To do so we will create a new Git repository, and push our existing code to it. An important part of this step is to configure the .gitignore correctly to avoid pushing our data to the repository.

At the end of this step we will have a versioned codebase we can share with our team !

## Instructions

{% callout type="warning" %}
This guide has been written for macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If you use Windows, you might encounter issues. 
// TODO remove "a decent terminal"
Please use [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for optimal results.
{% /callout %}

Create a new repository on your favorite Git service. Clone the repository and switch to your newly cloned repository.

{% callout type="note" %}
Using GitHub? Follow the related documentation [_Creating a new repository_ - docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) to create a new GitHub repository for this step.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="note" %}
Using GitLab? Follow the related documentation [_Create a project_ - docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/working_with_projects.html#create-a-project) to create a new GitLab project for this step.
{% /callout %}

Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the experiment results and some files related to Python.

```sh
## Custom experiment

# Data used to train the models
data

# The models
*.pkl

# The models evaluations
evaluation

## Python

# Environments
.venv

# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
```

Push the changes to Git.

```sh
# Add all the files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "My first ML experiment shared on GitLab"

# Push the changes
git push
```

Congrats! You now have a codebase that can be used and shared among the team.

When used by another member of the team, they can easily clone the experiment from Git.

```sh
# Clone the Git repository
git clone <the git repository url>
```

## Check the results

Want to see what the result of this step should look like? Have a look at the Git repository directory here: [step-2-share-your-ml-experiment-code-with-git](https://github.com/csia-pme/a-guide-to-mlops/tree/main/pages/the-guide/step-2-share-your-ml-experiment-code-with-git).

## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared among the developers. The codebase can be improved collaboratively;
- ❌ The dataset still needs to be downloaded and placed in the right directory in order to run the experiment;
- ❌ The steps used to create the model can be forgotten;
- ❌ The changes done to a model cannot be visualized and improvements and/or deteriorations are hard to identify;
- ❌ There is no guarantee that the experiment can be executed on another machine;
- ❌ The model might have required artifacts that can be forgotten or omitted when saving/loading the model for future usage. There is no easy way to use the model outside of the experiment context.
