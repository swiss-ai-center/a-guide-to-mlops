## Welcome

Welcome! We are glad that you are here. :)

This guide will help you through incremental steps from a traditional approach of managing ML projects to a modern ML Ops approach designed to improve team collaboration and reproducibility.

For the rest of the guide, an _experiment_ is a machine learning project.

We chose the term _experiment_ to address the experimental nature of the machine learning field before finding a suitable model.

## Disclaimer

This guide has been written for macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If you use Windows, you might encounter issues. Please use [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for optimal results.

This guide assumes that the steps to be performed are done in a working directory independently of it.

The tools and approach must be adapted to your specific use-case and experiments as well.
