title: "Step 7: Track model evolutions in the CI/CD pipeline with CML"
---

# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

## Summary

The purpose of this step is to track the model evolutions and generate reports directly in the CI/CD pipeline so it can be discussed collectively online before commiting the changes to the codebase.

{% callout type="note" %}
CML can do much more than just generating reports. Have a look to the [Train the model on a Kubernetes cluster with CML](/advanced-concepts/train-the-model-on-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cml) guide.

## Instructions

{% callout type="warning" %}
This guide has been written for macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If you use Windows, you might encounter issues. Please use a decent terminal ([GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for instance) or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for optimal results.
{% /callout %}

The reports generated by CML compare the current run with a target reference.

The target reference can be a specific commit (what are the differences between the current run and the run from the target commit) or a branch (what are the differences between the current run and the run from the target branch).

Many workflows exist to discuss and integrate the work done to a target reference. For the sake of simplicity, in this guide, we will present two methods that are commonly used on GitHub - Pull Requests (PRs) - and GitLab - Merge Requests (MRs) - to integrate the work done to the `main` branch.

### Update GitHub Actions and create a pull request

This GitHub Workflow will create CML reports on each pushes that are related to a pull request.

Push the changes to Git.

```sh
# Add the updated workflow
git add .github/workflows/mlops.yml

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Enable CML reports on pull requests"

# Push the changes
git push
```

Create a new issue by going to the **Issues** section from the top header of your GitHub repository. Select **New issue** and describe the work/improvements/ideas that you want to integrate to the codebase. In this guide, we will name the issue _Demonstrate step 7_. Create the issue by selecting **Submit new issue**.

The issue opens. Select **Create a branch for this issue or link a pull request** from the right sidebar. Create the branch by selecting **Create branch**. A new pop-up opens with the name of the branch you want to checkout to.

Go to the **Code** section from the top header of your GitHub repository. Select **_N_ branches** (where _N_ is the current number of branches your repository has). Next to the newly created branch, select **New pull request**. Name the pull request and select **Create pull request** to create the pull request.

{% callout type="note" %}
Highly inspired by the [_Using CML on GitLab_ - cml.dev](https://cml.dev/doc/start/gitlab) and [_Personal access tokens_ - docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) guides and the [`example_cml` - gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/iterative.ai/example_cml) and the [`cml-dvc-case` - gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/iterative.ai/cml-dvc-case) GitLab repositories.
{% /callout %}

In order to allow CML to generate reports, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be created. A Project or a Group Access Token are not sufficient for the usage of CML's runners that will be used in the next steps.

In your profile preferences, create a PAT with `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository` scopes and name it _"CML"_.

Store the PAT as a CI/CD Variable by going to **Settings > CI/CD** from the left sidebar of your GitLab project. Select **Variables** and select **Add variable**. Create a new variable named `CML_PAT_TOKEN` with the PAT value as its value. Check the _"Mask variable"_ box, uncheck _"Protect variable"_ and save the variable by selecting "Add variable".

Update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

This GitLab CI will create CML reports on each pushes that are related to a merge request.

Push the changes to Git.

```sh
# Add the updated workflow
git add .gitlab-ci.yml

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Enable CML reports on merge requests"

# Push the changes
git push
```

Create a new issue by going to the **Issues** section from the left sidebar of your GitLab project. Select **New issue** and describe the work/improvements/ideas that you want to integrate to the codebase. In this guide, we will name the issue _Demonstrate step 7_. Create the issue by selecting **Submit new issue**.

The issue opens.

Select **Create merge request** and change the merge request configuration if needed. Create the merge request by selecting **Create merge request**.

### Make changes to the model

Checkout the branch locally.

```sh
# Get the latest updates from the remote origin
git fetch origin

# Check to the new branch
git checkout <the name of the new branch>
```

Update the parameters to run the experiment in the `params.yaml` file.

```yaml
prepare:
  split: 0.25
  seed: 20170428

featurize:
  max_features: 500
  ngrams: 3

train:
  seed: 20170428
  n_est: 50
  min_split: 3
```

Run the experiment.

```sh
# Run the experiment. DVC will automatically run all required steps
dvc repro
```

Push the changes to DVC and Git.

```sh
# Upload the experiment data and cache to the remote bucket
dvc push

# Add all the files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "I made some changes to the model"

# Push the changes
git push
```

Congrats! You now have a report that will be generated on each PR/MR that can be visualized and discussed with the rest of the team before integrating the changes to the common codebase. When you are happy, you can merge the PR/MR on the target branch.

### GitHub: Merge the changes

{% callout type="note" %}
Using GitLab? Go to the [GitLab: Merge the changes](#gitlab-merge-the-changes) section!
{% /callout %}

Go back to the pull request. At the end of the page, select **Merge pull request**. Confirm the merge by selecting **Confirm merge**.

The associated issue will be automatically closed as well.

Congrats! You can now iterate on your model while keeping a trace of the improvements made to it.

{% callout type="note" %}
Finished? Go to the [Check the results](#check-the-results) section!
{% /callout %}

### GitLab: Merge the changes

{% callout type="note" %}
Using GitHub? Go to the [GitHub: Merge the changes](#github-merge-the-changes) section!
{% /callout %}

Go back to the merge request. Select **Mark as ready**. This will allow to merge the changes. Confirm the merge by selecting **Merge** (you might need to refresh the page to see this button).

The associated issue will be automatically closed as well.

Congrats! You can now iterate on your model while keeping a trace of the improvements made to it.

## Check the results

Want to see what the result of this step should look like? Have a look at the Git repository directory here: [step-7-track-model-evolutions-in-the-cicd-pipeline-with-cml](https://github.com/csia-pme/a-guide-to-mlops/tree/main/pages/the-guide/step-7-track-model-evolutions-in-the-cicd-pipeline-with-cml).

## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared among the developers. The codebase can be improved collaboratively;
- ✅ The dataset can be shared among the developers and is placed in the right directory in order to run the experiment;
- ✅ The steps used to create the model are documented and can be re-executed;
- ✅ The experiment can be executed on a clean machine with the help of the CI/CD pipeline;
- ✅ The changes done to a model can be visualized with parameters, metrics and plots to identify differences between iterations with the help of the CI/CD pipeline;
- ❌ The model might have required artifacts that can be forgotten or omitted when saving/loading the model for future usage. There is no easy way to use the model outside of the experiment context.
