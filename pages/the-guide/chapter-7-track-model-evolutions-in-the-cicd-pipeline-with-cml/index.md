title: "Chapter 7: Track model evolutions in the CI/CD pipeline with CML"
---

# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to track the model evolutions and generate reports directly in the CI/CD pipeline so it can be discussed collectively online before commiting the changes to the codebase.

In this chapter, you'll cover:

- Updating the CI/CD configuration file to generate a CML report
- Pushing the updated CI/CD configuration file to Git
- Opening an issue in your issue tracker
- Creating a new branch to add your changes
- Swithing to the new branch
- Commiting and pushing the changes that were not commited in [Chapter 5: Track model evolutions with DVC](/the-guide/chapter-5-track-model-evolutions-with-dvc)
- Creating a Pull Request/Merge Request
- Visualizing the execution of the CI/CD pipeline
- Visualizing the CML report that is added to your Pull Request/Merge Request
- Merging the Pull Request/Merge Request to the main branch
- Switching back to the main branch and pulling latest changes

{% callout type="note" %}
CML can do much more than just generating reports. Have a look to the [Train the model on a Kubernetes cluster with CML](/advanced-concepts/train-the-model-on-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-cml) guide.

## Steps

{% callout type="warning" %}
This guide has been written with macOS and Linux operating systems in mind. If you use Windows, you might encounter issues. Please use [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for optimal results.
{% /callout %}

The reports generated by CML compare the current run with a target reference.

The target reference can be a specific commit (what are the differences between the current run and the run from the target commit) or a branch (what are the differences between the current run and the run from the target branch).

Many workflows exist to discuss and integrate the work done to a target reference. For the sake of simplicity, in this guide, we will present two methods that are commonly used on GitHub - Pull Requests (PRs) - and GitLab - Merge Requests (MRs) - to integrate the work done to the `main` branch.

#### Update GitHub Actions configuration file

The new "report" job is responsible for reporting the results of the model evaluation and comparing it with the main branch.

This job is triggered only when a pull request is opened.

The job checks out the repository, downloads the evaluation results, sets up DVC and CML in the container, creates a report using the data obtained from the training job, and finally publishes the report as a pull request comment.

Update the `.github/workflows/mlops.yml` file.

  # Runs on pushes targeting main branch

#### Push the changes to GitHub

```sh
# Add the updated workflow
git add .github/workflows/mlops.yml

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Enable CML reports on pull requests"

# Push the changes
git push
```

#### Open an issue on GitHub

Create a new issue by going to the **Issues** section from the top header of your GitHub repository. Select **New issue** and describe the work/improvements/ideas that you want to integrate to the codebase. In this guide, we will name the issue _Demonstrate step 7_. Create the issue by selecting **Submit new issue**.

#### Create a branch on GitHub

On the newly created issue, select **Create a branch for this issue or link a pull request** from the right sidebar. Create the branch by selecting **Create branch**. A new pop-up opens with the name of the branch you want to checkout to.

#### Checkout the new GitHub branch

On your machine, check out the new branch.

```sh
# Get the latest updates from the remote origin
git fetch origin

# Check to the new branch
git checkout <the name of the new branch>
```

#### Commit and push the experiment changes to GitHub

Remember the changes done in [Chapter 5: Track model evolutions with DVC](/the-guide/chapter-5-track-model-evolutions-with-dvc)?

You can now commit them to trigger a change on the remote repository.

If you don't have changes in your working directory, just update the paramerters of the experiment in `params.yaml` and reproduce the experiment with `dvc repro`. You can then commit the changes.

```sh
# Upload the experiment data and cache to the remote bucket
dvc push

# Add all the files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "I made some changes to the model"

# Push the changes
git push
```

In order to allow CML to generate reports, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be created. A Project or a Group Access Token are not sufficient for the usage of CML's runners that will be used in the next steps.

In your profile preferences, create a PAT with `api`, `read_repository` and `write_repository` scopes and name it _"CML"_.

Store the PAT as a CI/CD Variable by going to **Settings > CI/CD** from the left sidebar of your GitLab project. Select **Variables** and select **Add variable**. Create a new variable named `CML_PAT_TOKEN` with the PAT value as its value. Check the _"Mask variable"_ box, uncheck _"Protect variable"_ and save the variable by selecting "Add variable".

#### Update the workflow 

The new "report" job is responsible for reporting the results of the model evaluation and comparing it with the main branch. 
This job is triggered only when a pull request is opened. 

The job checks out the repository, downloads the evaluation results, sets up DVC and CML in the container, creates a report using the data obtained from the training job, and finally publishes the report as a pull request comment.

Update the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

### Make changes to the model

The goal of this section is to make changes to the model and to compare the results with the previous version.

#### Update the parameters to run the experiment.

In the `params.yaml` file.

```yaml
prepare:
  split: 0.25
  seed: 20170428

featurize:
  max_features: 500
  ngrams: 3

train:
  seed: 20170428
  n_est: 50
  min_split: 3
```

#### Run the experiment.

```sh
# Run the experiment. DVC will automatically run all required stages
dvc repro
```

#### Push the changes to DVC and Git.

```sh
# Upload the experiment data and cache to the remote bucket
dvc push

# Add all the files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "I made some changes to the model"

# Push the changes
git push
```

Congrats! You now have a report that will be generated on each PR/MR that can be visualized and discussed with the rest of the team before integrating the changes to the common codebase. When you are happy, you can merge the PR/MR on the target branch.

### GitHub: Merge the changes

- Visualized the execution of the CI/CD pipeline
- Visualized the CML report that is added to your Pull Request/Merge Request
- Merged the Pull Request/Merge Request to the main branch
- Switched back to the main branch and pull latest changes

However, you might have identified the following areas for improvement:

- ❌ How can I serve my model to the rest of the world?

In the next chapters, you will enhance the workflow to fix those issues.

You can now safely continue to the next chapter.

## State of the MLOps process

- ✅ The codebase can be shared and improved by multiple developers;
- ✅ The dataset can be shared among the developers and is placed in the right directory in order to run the experiment;
- ✅ The steps used to create the model are documented and can be re-executed;
- ✅ The changes done to a model can be visualized with parameters, metrics and plots to identify differences between iterations;
- ✅ The experiment can be executed on a clean machine with the help of a CI/CD pipeline and CML;
- ❌ Model may have required artifacts that are forgotten or omitted in saved/loaded state. There is no easy way to use the model outside of the experiment context.
