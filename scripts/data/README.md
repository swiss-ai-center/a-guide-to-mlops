# Data Generation

The data is based of a tabular dataset of planet features as well as with a classification of its habitability:

-   `non-habitable (0)` - the planet is not habitable
-   `habitable (1)` - the planet is habitable

It's features and relationships can be modified with the respective `FEATURES` and `RELATIONSHIPS` variables in the `generate_data.py` script.
